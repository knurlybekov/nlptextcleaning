labour,"is it good for our health and longevity to heave dig hoist stroll or otherwise exert ourselves during working hours or are strenuous occupations hard on our bodies and health . common sense might tell us that being in motion at work should be beneficial for our hearts and health just as going for a jog or bike ride or working out at the gym is good for us. but some recent research has suggested that manual labor often increases workers risks for cardiovascular disease and premature death meaning the effects of work related physical activity might be different and less salubrious than those of the workouts we choose to do on our own time. now though the newest and largest study to date of occupational physical activity and mortality has some good news for those with physically demanding jobs. the new study which involved almost half a million workers finds that people whose jobs involve frequent moving and lifting tend to live longer than those whose occupations are deskbound. the results refute the idea that worktime exertions somehow are different than other exercise and instead suggest that whenever possible we should be on the move while on the job. no one disputes that exercise is beneficial and in general the more the better. but exercise is volitional we can decide for the most part whether when where how long how hard and with whom we will work out. it has not been altogether clear whether mandatory physical activity affects our bodies in the same ways as workouts we choose for ourselves. when mice or rats run on treadmills where the pace intensity duration and mere existence of the workouts are set for them they typically produce stress hormones and often wind up with different biological outcomes than if they skitter through the same mileage on running wheels something rodents voluntarily seem to love to do. in an interesting 2008 study rats running on treadmills developed higher levels of anxiety than rats running on wheels and showed different effects on the production of new neurons in their brains. familiar with this area of research some exercise scientists started to wonder a few years ago if workplace physical activity which can be compulsory might likewise produce different and potentially less desirable physiological effects on people than leisure time exercise. to find out they checked survey data about occupational physical activity against death registries. and they uncovered sobering associations. according to a 2018 analysis of more than a dozen relevant studies men whose jobs demanded frequent lifting carrying and other tiring physical labor were 18 percent more likely to die prematurely than men whose jobs were less physically demanding. the studies found no associations between women s occupational activities and longevity. the review s authors and other scientists called their findings a physical activity paradox in which having to move at work seemed to undermine men s health and life spans while choosing to exercise during off hours improved them. but some exercise researchers remained skeptical. these scientists suspected that any relationship between hard labor and early death might be due more to people s lives away from the job than to their exertions at work and that past research had not controlled adequately for lifestyle. so for the new study which was published in april in the lancet public health researchers at the norwegian school of sport sciences in oslo and other institutions decided to delve as deeply and broadly as possible into lifestyle as well as workplace labor and life spans. they began by turning to data already gathered by norwegian health agencies which as part of ongoing studies have been measuring the health of hundreds of thousands of norwegians for decades. that data included detailed information about their work and exercise histories education income and other aspects of their lives. the researchers now pulled records for 437378 of the participants in these studies and categorized them by job types. some like clerks or inspectors did some walking and lifting at work others performed heavy manual labor and the rest more or less sat at their desks all day. the researchers then crosschecked people s records against decades worth of databases tracking diseases and deaths in norway. on a first pass their results bolstered the idea that active jobs shorten lives. over the course of about 30 years men in sedentary jobs outlived those who often walked or otherwise exerted themselves at work. as before there were no significant links between women s professions and their longevity. but when the scientists scrupulously controlled for everyone s education income smoking exercise habits and weight the associations flipped. in this fuller analysis men who were active at work developed heart disease and cancer at lower rates than deskbound men. whether they tended to walk a fair amount for work or perform other more strenuous labor the active men lived on average about a year longer. in essence the study shows that every movement counts regardless of whether you are active at work or during leisure says ulf ekelund a professor at the norwegian school of sport sciences who oversaw the new study. conversely the results also remind us he says that sitting even at comfortable desks or on cushy couches is unhealthy. what this study does not tell us is which aspects of our lives away from work might most affect our health and longevity or why women s life spans seem generally unaffected by worktime exertions. dr. ekelund and his colleagues hope to look into some of those issues in future research. but for now he says assume that all physical activity is beneficial regardless of whether it s performed during leisure at work at home or during transportation.

weather,"a logo of the exxon mobil corp is seen at the rio oil and gas expo and conference in rio de janeiro brazil september 24 2018. houston june 22 reuters investors calling for exxon mobil corp to study the impact of getting its oil and gas business to net zero emissions by 2050 will push for talks later this year with what they hope is a more sympathetic board. exxon shareholders voted in favor of the study a regulatory filing showed on monday. companies typically respond to proposals that get majority support from investors. we were validated said john geissinger chief investment officer at christian brothers investment services cbis which wants exxon to quantify the financial impact of a net zero strategy. a significant number of shareholders believe that assessing the risks to the company under different climate scenarios is critically important. geissinger expects to hold talks with exxon this fall on the proposal and hopes to collaborate on the outlines of the report. the cbis proposal won support of big investors blackrock and state street global advisors which combined hold more than 12 of exxon shares. we want to have some transparency to the risks that the company faces geissinger said. the requested report would examine the impact on exxon of a world moving to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. exxon recommended shareholders vote against the proposal citing the range of scenarios within its planning. but a quarter of its board lost their seats to nominees of a hedge fund prodding exxon to cut spending on fossil fuels and address a world moving to lower carbon fuels. we value the input and feedback we receive from our investors and we will continue to engage with our shareholders as we move forward exxon spokesman casey norton said. exxon has pledged to limit the pace of growth of carbon emissions that contribute to climate change but has not agreed to net zero emissions by 2050 as rivals bp plc royal dutch shell and totalenergies have done.

labour,"akinse at atrenta or fifteen thirty perhaps the most awaited date on the calendar for most employees and one of the most dreaded dates for the employers. while the country is still crippled by the percent unemployment rate because of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic as reported by the philippines statistics authority and employers are finding ways to minimize operational cost it is still surprising to hear stories of small and medium enterprise owners trying to keep their workforce intact and meeting the fifteen thirty deadline for their payroll. as owners of small businesses perhaps you are often tempted to delay your employees salaries or worse lay them off but there are more benefits to paying your employees on time than skipping payments just to save a few pesos. you are not just feeding one person but a whole family is what i often hear from my clients who are seeking financing to bridge their payroll and i could not help but agree. most employees rely on their stable paycheck to sustain their families. a delayed paycheck could mean a disconnected electricity bill a missed hospital bill or even a skipped meal. if you pay your employees regularly you contribute to your employees sense of financial security and mental stability. this in turn results in higher productivity as your employees will have less time to think about their obligations and focus only on work. as they put it happy employees happy workplace. a stable paycheck is also directly related to employee retention and overall workplace satisfaction. by paying your employees on time you assure them that their contributions are rewarded and that you have an intention to work with them for a longer time. who would want to stay with an employer who often misses their payment but demands for more output right not to mention that hiring new employees due to high turnover costs more than keeping them as this would mean additional costs for training screening and lost productivity. lastly paying your employees on time reflects the kind of values you uphold as an employer. while the goal of every business is to gain more profit it is also important to make your employees feel valued. this is equal to saying that you do not only treat your employees as moneymaking machines but your business s main driver of success. it boosts your employees morale and makes them feel that your business goals are aligned with theirs. now as an employer how do you make sure that you will not miss your employees payroll . oftentimes employers miss their payroll because of unexpected payment to suppliers or delayed collections from buyers. thus it is important to be familiar with your company s monthly cash flow and keep track of your expenses while making sure that you have enough funds to cover the upcoming payroll. delayed collections are inevitable in every business but this should not be an excuse to delay your employees salaries as well. organize and understand your cut off and payment schedule. know how long it usually takes to process document submissions fund releases and even banking hours. you would not want to lose a valuable employee just because you missed the timing. get access to bridge or short term financing. as filipino business owners we often go to our relatives or friends who can lend us some money with a promise to pay after a month or two whenever we are short of cash. it is a quick and easy solution but not always available especially if you need a bigger amount than usual. this calls the need for a financing partner who can offer short term loans to bridge cash flow gaps. short term financing allows you to get quick access to funds to cover your payroll and unexpected expenses while waiting for your receivables to be collected. the good thing about this is that you will not be tied to long term debt which can even affect your cash flow in the long run. while this puts a heavier accountability on the employer s side especially in this pandemic we must understand that putting up a business entails the labor cost. it is not something that can be removed from the equation. for a small business owner managing the payroll alone can be a stressful task but a wise business owner should know that paying them on time should be your responsibility and priority. after all they are your business most valuable asset. pinkle evangelio is one of the newest relationship managers at first circle. her main role involves having in depth conversations with sme owners and building long term relationships with her clients. prior to this new position she also worked as a sales development representative and as an account manager in the company. you may reach her at email protected .'

environmental,"plans to create a huge commercial farm next to a national park in zambia could have a catastrophic impact on wildlife conservationists have warned threatening vital habitat for bats undertaking the world s biggest mammal migration. farm plan poses catastrophic threat to zambian park vital for fruit bats every october about 10 million straw coloured fruit bats descend on the evergreen swamps of kasanka national park in central zambia from across africa feasting on figs and fruit and berries in the surrounding area and dispersing seeds across the continent in their epic journey. the park is home to 479 bird species and 114 mammals. but the clouds of flying mammals that fill the sky could disappear entirely park officials have warned if proposals for wheat soya and maize farming over 7000 hectares 17500 acres in the buffer zone surrounding the protected area are given approval. lake agro owned by a tanzanian conglomerate has put forward plans to establish the farming operation roughly two miles 3km from the national park s borders which would mean clearing thousands of hectares of pristine habitat and drawing on water from the nearby luwombwa river. they have proposed that an alternative site is found for the farm away from the national park. the income from the bats creates direct employment for local people said james mwanza general manager of the kasanka trust which co manages the protected area. this project not only has the potential to kill kasanka national park but also the image zambia has in terms of tourism management. in a letter to zambia s environmental management agency backed by several environmental organisations kasanka trust said that it had not been consulted about the proposals and raised concerns about the quality of an environmental assessment submitted for the farm. mwanza said that if the farm were approved it would open the buffer zone surrounding the park to more commercial farming which could have catastrophic and irreversible impacts on the luwombwa river kasanka and the straw coloured fruit bat migration. chuma simukonda managing director of zambia s department of national parks and wildlife said that while he welcomed investment in zambia s agricultural industry another site for the commercial farm must be found. we understand farming is a good thing. this kind of investment is of course good for zambia because it is development it brings employment and it will certainly increase the food basket he said. however it is happening in the wrong place.

crime,"gamepur 49 mins ago chris compendio . provided by gamepur . according to chicory the spoons island wielder trial in chicory a colorful tale is meant to represent finding your path as a wielder or something like that. finding your path on this island will take some platform manipulation going back and forth and solving some line puzzles. provided by gamepur screenshot by gamepur . after talking to chicory go up to the higher ground and go down a screen. there will be four platforms that you can raise up with dot switches in the center of them as you can probably figure out each platform corresponds to a different dot. take the bottom right platform and jump off of it to go to the screen on the right. on the next screen you will have to push an exploding paintball to the right platform lower that platform take it onto the left platform and then raise that left platform. keep in mind that you cannot push these paint balls off of ledges and have to take them with you. the next screens down are where things get complicated. there will be a grid of 3 2 platforms but the dot switches are to the screen on the left. first go to the screen on the left and activate the bottom center and bottom left platforms. go back to the right screen and use the plant on the very bottom right to launch yourself onto the bottom center platform. jump to the bottom left platform and then you can actually jump up across the gap to be in the top part of the screen go to the left screen activate all of the switches and then go back to the right to platform your way to the next screen on the right. there will be a switch on the screen with the platforms to reset everything if you mess up. next raise the center platform to swim up with the right platform down you can jump across the gap and go down a screen. then get on the top right platform and raise both top platforms. bounce your way onto the bottom right platform and raise it so you can use the bouncing bush on the right to hop your way towards the next right screen. provided by gamepur screenshot by gamepur . before messing around with the platforms on the next screen swim up to the exploding paintball. raise the first platform and move the ball onto it. then lower the first platform. push the ball onto the second platform and raise it push the ball onto higher ground. finally raise the fourth platform and get yourself and the ball onto it. lower that platform and push the ball down to blow up the rocks. from the next screen down go to the right then down again. here you will have to solve your first line puzzle. you will use the dot switches to move the platforms up and down and you have to make sure that there is a continuous black line between the two large black dots on the screen. take this one platform at a time from left to right but we also have the solution in picture form above if you get stuck. provided by gamepur screenshot by gamepur . the next two screens will have you go back and forth as the dot switches on one screen affect the platforms on the other screen. fill in the bottom right dot on the left screen then on the right screen use the bottom right platform to jump across the gap. while still on the right fill in the bottom center and right dots to create a bridge on the left screen along with the top center dot. on the left screen walk across the bridge go around jump diagonally upward to the right and use the platform there to jump across to the right. before going back to the right screen fill in the top center and top left dots. on the right screen jump downwards onto their respective platforms and walk up to the next couple of screens. provided by gamepur screenshot by gamepur . you will reach a door with four quadrants of dots there will be four line puzzles for you to solve to open this door. there are two paths one to the left and another to the right. you can do these puzzles in any order and provide picture solutions for each of them. provided by gamepur screenshot by gamepur . go to the right screen with two platforms then take the right platform to the right screen to reach this puzzle seen above. provided by gamepur

social,sydney march 18 xinhua in the digital age controlling the amount of time children spend in front of screens is a top concern for parents according to a report released thursday by the royal children s hospital in melbourne australia. the study showed that traditional health concerns have taken a back seat to more modern pressures such as poor diet lack of activity and excessive screen time. close to 2000 parents of children aged from one month to 18 years were surveyed with excessive screen time coming out as the number one health concern in 2021. our lives are saturated by digital screens and it can be difficult to reduce screen time for children when so much of their education and recreation activities are on these devices particularly in the year 2020 with home learning the norm paediatrician and acting poll director dr margie danchin said. tied to the concern of excessive online activity was cyberbullying and internet safety which parents also ranked as being of significant concern as well as associated lifestyle issues such as unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity. danchin said that the results of the survey were similar to that of a poll conducted five years ago showing that the way children use digital media was an ongoing issue. however she issued some advice for parents wanting to get their kids away from screens including encouraging participation in sports and other outdoor activities or simply walking to the shops or school each day instead of driving. if we continue to encourage physical activity and time outdoors we can reduce screen time and address some of the other concerns of parents such as lack of physical activity and obesity danchin said. she added it was important for parents to model healthy behaviour for their children and to maintain positive parent child relationships and encourage open communication.

environmental,"unfortunately is marking world environment day amid multiple environmental crises impacting its seas waters forests air and agricultural lands. especially the mucilage invading the marmara sea has recently become one of the grave environmental concerns threatening life underwater and above the sea. according to experts the discharge of industrial and domestic wastes into the sea the dumping of billions of tons of excavation soil into the sea and the failure to take timely measures led to the mucilage invasion in the marmara sea. they also warn that it can further spread to the black sea and the aegean in case no efficient action is taken. the environment and urbanization ministry announced that an urgent workshop would be organized this weekend to create an action map to fight the mucilage problem just around a month after the first reports about the invasion were revealed. turkey s forests and natural beauties are also under threat of mining quarrying and power plants. for those who don t know the turkish parliament has a panel especially established to inquire about the impacts of global warming. at a meeting last week officials from the tema a foundation for reforestation and the protection of natural habitats as well as combating erosion have outlined how serious the problem was. they reported that 17900 mining licenses were issued in 2015 2016 and 2017 for the areas covering the forest area and as a result 146000 hectares of forest cover was lost. desertification is the biggest environmental problem of turkey they stressed citing the irreversible destruction of the country s natural habitat at the hands of insatiable capitalist drives. tema president deniz ata listed three main reasons because of which environmental degradation cannot be prevented inability to produce necessary policies deficiencies regarding legal acquis and lack of proper implementation. the fact that turkish politics do not put environmental issues at the center of political priorities has caused those reasons to become structural. however there is bad news for those politicians. one of the important consequences of the pandemic was that people started to see better the relationship between health and the environment and the importance of preserving nature. urban and rural classes are increasingly expressing their discomfort about the disruption of nature due to aggressive economic and industrial activities and are demanding a cleaner nature and environmentally friendly country. almost all scientists warn that turkey will be among the countries most affected by global warming in the coming decades. increasing drought decrease in clean water resources and shrinkage of agricultural lands are among the effects already seen. turkey has not yet ratified the 2015 paris climate convention for well known reasons. it rejects to be listed among the developed nations as this status brings financial and political burdens. but it s also known that the paris convention has decreased the burden falling on the shoulders of individual nations and that turkey s ratification will not bring additional cost. in a recent statement environment and urbanization minister mehmet kurum admitted that turkey was not a party to the convention but was still fulfilling its responsibility in the global fight against climate change. the point is that the fight for a better and greener world requires global cooperation as unilateral efforts may fail. with only a few months to go for the global climate summit it s time for turkey to reconsider its position vis vis the convention. consequently turkey should also be aware that its failure to accommodate the european union s green deal will result in great economic losses and trade disadvantages. at the same time the eu s green deal could bring opportunities if turkey moves fast for a full green transformation of its economy and industry. of course a mental transformation is required in order to do all this. it should be understood that the economy can grow by protecting and enriching the environment not by destroying it. this may require larger investments in renewable resources but we only have one world and one country to live in. turkey with its entire people politics and civil society should launch a green revolution before it gets too late.

lifestyle,"there s no denying that weddings are joyful but they also come freighted with a list of unwritten rules which guests should obey but often breach. of course during the pandemic weddings and other significant life events from civil partnerships to funerals baptisms barmitzvahs and batmitzvahs have been governed by another tougher but necessary set of guidelines downsized guest numbers hand sanitisation after exchanging rings fathers walking their daughters down the aisle 1 metre apart. the good news is that last monday 21 june in england many of these rules were relaxed. the advice that only 30 people could attend an event has been be lifted the final headcount now depends on how many people the venue can safely accommodate. meanwhile weddings wakes and other gatherings can be held in gardens barns and on private land. hen and stag parties can also take place. however with the delta variant of the virus still spreading in the uk there are a few additional rules to ensure everybody is kept safe. these range from increased air ventilation for marquees to conducting a risk assessment don t worry guests this won t be your responsibility. all the usual advice on social distancing and hygiene such as hand washing remains the same. getting together with loved ones is something many of us have craved over the past 16 months. whether you re celebrating as a happy couple ties the knot or saying goodbye to a dear old friend here s how to do it in the safest manner possible . can brides and grooms still have the big wedding that they d always planned yes but only if their venue can safely accommodate the guests. the 30 person cap on weddings and civil partnerships was lifted on 21 june but venues will still need to do some maths calculating how many people their space can hold in accordance with social distancing measures. this also applies to funerals and wakes. if the event is being staged in a covid secure venue such as a hotel restaurant church mosque temple or synagogue then this venue should already be taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. the event s organisers should contact the venue manager beforehand to see how many guests can safely attend. do i need to wear my face mask if i m a guest at a wedding the rules apply just as if you re travelling on a train or shopping in a supermarket. your face covering should be worn during both the ceremony and reception except when you re eating and drinking. the only people exempt are the newlyweds the person officiating at the service and those with medical conditions. if you re attending an outdoor wedding there s no legal requirement to wear a mask but you may wish to do so for your own safety. what happens if i m attending a wedding or wake somewhere that isn t covid secure such as a private home if a wedding or wake is being held inside a private home or another enclosed space then the guestlist will be limited to either six people or two households. however if it s a deathbed wedding ceremony where one partner is terminally ill this can be increased to 30 people. do outdoor weddings or wakes need to adhere to these rules too if a wedding or wake is taking place in the garden of a private home a field beach or any other outdoor space there s no cap on guest numbers. however if more than 30 people are attending a risk assessment see below will need to be carried out. social distancing measures for outside space will still apply. the popularity of marquees at weddings throws up a conundrum are they indoor or outdoor venues it all comes down to the walls of the marquee if two sides of the canvas are removed or rolled up the increased ventilation this brings means that a marquee based reception will count as being outdoors . the words risk assessment were mentioned. what does this involve and how onerous is it if the event takes place somewhere used for commercial or hospitality purposes such as a hotel or restaurant then the venue itself should have carried out a risk assessment beforehand. however if the ceremony and reception are being hosted somewhere that isn t covid secure such as a private garden or barn then the organiser should carry out the risk assessment themselves. it s a simple evaluation that starts with the organiser noting down any risks on a document. for example do you have any vulnerable guests the next step is to identify and implement the best actions to minimise the risk of transmission between guests such as establishing more routes to the bathroom increasing ventilation in the venue or installing more hand sanitisation areas. if the wedding involves outside suppliers such as caterers they ll also need to complete a risk assessment and share it with the organiser. failure to conduct a risk assessment could result in a 10000 fine. dancefloors will remain closed but brides and grooms will be able to have their first dance. photograph roberto westbrook getty images tetra images rf . there are few things i love more at a wedding than a good old boogie. can i still showcase my moves sadly dancing isn t advised because of the increased risk of transmission. dancefloors will remain closed with many venues likely to repurpose them for additional seating space. there is of course one exception brides and grooms will be able to have their first dance together meaning they can shimmy samba jitterbug or foxtrot away to their hearts content. my friends have booked a band for their wedding. will it still be able to perform yes but any bands or choirs must be limited to six members indoors. meanwhile because singing increases the risk of airborne transmission of covid 19 through aerosol particles and small droplets guests are advised not to join in singing with bands or choirs. how are other nuptial traditions affected by the new guidance wedding speeches should either be conducted outside or by using a pa system so that the speaker doesn t need to shout or project their voice. cutting the cake and playing games can still take place but guests will need to exercise the same precautions as they would in any public place such as wearing face coverings. guest books photo booths shared orders of service and games are permitted. however because a number of people are likely to end up touching these objects their usage should be minimised and hand sanitisation encouraged. as for wedding meals it s table service only with no buffets allowed. the uk alliance of wedding planners has suggested some covid safe ideas for weddings such as traditional games quiz nights stand up comics and outdoor sports. what about hen or stag dos these can still take place. however if taking place indoors the numbers attending these prenuptial shindigs are capped at six people or two households. outdoors no more than 30 merrymakers can attend. do the wedding rules apply to other events the numbers attending funerals and other commemorative events such as stone settings and ash scatterings are no longer curbed at 30 people. however cash charity donations are discouraged online platforms such as justgiving are a better idea. what happens if i don t obey the rules above if you arrange a gathering but ignore these latest rules you could face a 10000 fine. if a couple fails to do proper risk assessment on their ceremony then they could be hit with this 10000 penalty """

health,"imagine last night you developed a little runny nose and a sore throat. when you woke up this morning you started coughing and had a fever. in the past year your mind would have immediately jumped to covid 19. but if you are already fully vaccinated you might wonder should i still get tested for covid 19 . as an infectious disease physician i am often asked this question. if you have symptoms of covid 19 you should get tested for covid 19 even if you are fully vaccinated. you won t be at high risk for hospitalization or severe disease but if you are infected you may pass the virus to an unvaccinated person who could then get very sick. vaccines work but aren t 100 effective . the high efficacy of these vaccines in the closely controlled environment of clinical trials matches their effectiveness in real life. the mrna vaccines made by pfizer and moderna remain over 90 effective in preventing hospitalization or death. that does not however mean that you have the same degree of protection from getting infected. the latest research estimates that the mrna vaccines offer 70 to 85 protection from getting infected at all. it s impossible to know whether a person is fully protected or could still develop a mild case if exposed to the coronavirus. if you did happen to get infected you could still spread the virus. and that s why testing is still important. what is a breakthrough case . breakthrough cases demonstrate a basic principle of infectious disease whether or not a person gets infected depends on the balance between two factors intensity of exposure and immune competence. intensity of exposure relates to how close an uninfected person is to a highly infectious individual spewing virus while talking and how long the two people are in contact. immune competence relates to the body s inherent protection against covid 19. unvaccinated individuals who ve never been infected with the coronavirus have no protection this is a completely new virus after all while fully vaccinated people will be much more protected. according to the cdc as of april 30 2021 there had been a total of 10262 known sars cov 2 vaccine breakthrough infections in states and territories. these are usually asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic cases and most don t result in hospitalization. breakthrough cases will continue to occur and though these people are less likely to spread the coronavirus to others than are unvaccinated individuals they still probably can. and what about the sars cov 2 variants well the world has been fortunate that the mrna vaccines in particular afford significant protection against all major variants that have emerged so far. but it is entirely possible that at some point a coronavirus strain could mutate and partially or fully escape the protection from vaccines. this is yet another good reason to get tested if you are feeling sick. as vaccination rates rise and daily case counts fall in the and other countries it is also important to keep a close eye on the coronavirus. covid 19 testing allows officials to keep track of how much virus is in a community and positive test results can help people quarantine before unknowingly spreading the virus to others. so yes please get tested if you have concerning symptoms even if you are fully """

other,"the recent surge in virus cases in indonesia was not unexpected. despite a government ban official figures show that at least million people mostly from jakarta had travelled to their home towns to celebrate the hari raya aidilfitri holidays last month in an annual exodus known locally as mudik. the government went all out to remind us to stay at home not to mudik but we still went ahead. this is the consequence coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment luhut pandjaitan said at a virtual conference recently. indonesia remains the worst hit country in south east asia by far with million cases including more than 54000 deaths. huge clusters have emerged in a number of regencies in java with new variants including the virulent delta variant first detected in india showing up. yesterday the health authorities reported 12990 new cases the highest daily rise since february led by jakarta with 4737 cases west java with 2791 cases and central java with 1331 cases. jakarta governor anies baswedan has warned that the capital city of 11 million which is the epicentre of the outbreak will enter a critical phase if the situation goes out of control. epidemiologist dicky budiman from australia s griffith university told the straits times that the situation is likely as bad if not worse outside jakarta but is hard to measure due to poor data. we start with very poor data and poor understanding of the current situation. seeing this as a jakarta problem is very wrong and dangerous. there are growing calls for a lockdown to curb the spread of the virus as hospital bed occupancy in jakarta shot up to 75 per cent from 45 per cent last week. 1963226 . dr dicky said there is a big probability that indonesia may face a similar situation as in india in terms of a rise in the number of cases and deaths. lockdown should be one of our weapons or a hammer to contain the delta variant he added. the world health organisation stated in its report on thursday with increased transmission due to variants of concern urgent action is needed to contain the situation in many provinces. the world bank s indonesia economic prospects report released on the same day made similar recommendations. besides accelerating a vaccine roll out indonesia should improve testing tracing and isolating of cases as well as impose adequate mobility curbs. it noted that indonesia s free vaccine roll out has begun to lag behind some of its group of 20 peers despite an earlier and stronger start. the pandemic risks still loom large with cases increasing significantly in june. indonesia remains vulnerable to new waves driven by more transmissible strains as experienced by other countries as well as potentially higher mobility and viral transmission during festivities. the vaccination drive which started strongly in january has been languishing due to logistical issues and mismanagement said mr achmad sukarsono associate director and lead analyst for indonesia at control risks. there is no light at the end of the tunnel just yet he said in a june 1 outlook report. with delays in distribution and cases of vaccine theft by officials placing too much hope on the vaccination drive will lead to disappointment. but the government has never been keen on nationwide lockdowns due to fears of economic repercussions. a localised lockdown is an option said mr achmad. vaccination it appears remains a silver bullet solution with the government planning to ramp up the daily inoculation rate to one million doses a day. president joko widodo has ordered jakarta to vaccinate 100000 people a day to reach herd immunity by august. he admitted that it is an ambitious target but we have no other options but to do it . professor hasbullah thabrany public health expert and chief of the indonesian health economic association said while there is no room for complacency the infection figures must be taken in perspective as indonesia has a population of 270 million people. in terms of percentage 10000 cases in indonesia is far smaller than 10000 in malaysia or the philippines he said adding that the current spike is still lower than the peak in january with daily cases of around """

lifestyle,"karen hirsch public relations director for lifeline animal project said people who open their homes to older pets just have a special place in their hearts. jolie gallagher and her family s three dogs from left to right cricket ruby and cooper. courtesy of jolie gallagher . sometimes the older pets come in as strays. perhaps they escaped the owners felt they were too big or they were dumped by their owners because of the expense of keeping them. some are dropped off at the shelter because the owner has died or the owner has to move to a nursing home or assisted living facility that doesn t allow animals. explore when you re gone what happens to your pets . you have to look at it as a mission that you re giving that dog a home and a second chance said becky cross director of atlanta lab rescue. the rescue takes in 450 to 500 dogs annually of which 10 to 15 would be considered seniors. alr reduces the 375 adoption fee by 125 for a dog at least 7 years old and waives the fee for dogs 10 and older. if there s a significant medical condition at the time of an adoption the nonprofit will consider the dog a permanent foster and continue to pay its medical bills said cross. charlie kleman a retired corporate executive is chairman of alr s board and a volunteer who often logs hundreds of miles a day ferrying homeless dogs to the vet kennels and foster or forever homes. sometimes his passengers are older dogs. by the time they re 8 or 10 years old they re used to being around somebody he said. when they re abandoned or strays or surrendered they re so confused. they re happy to get out of the shelters. half of the older ones will want to put their paws on my lap and they can t stop wagging their tails kleman said. older cats and dogs can live full healthy lives. others like people experience health issues as they age. lifeline has some older cats from time to time and they are also harder to place than younger ones. there is some debate about how old is elderly for cats hirsch wrote in an email. according to the american association of feline practitioners senior care guidelines older cats are classified as mature or middle aged at 7 to 10 years old as senior cats at 11 to 14 years old and geriatric from 15 to 25 years old. hirsch said her last three cats lived to be 17 18 and 20. like their human counterparts older pets are more likely to develop age related health issues such as arthritis heart kidney and liver disease according to the american veterinary medical association. dogs get cancer at roughly the same rate as humans while cats typically have a lower rate. atlanta artist lawson thomas chambers had a roommate who had older dogs. in 2018 when chambers who prefers using a gender neutral pronoun decided to foster they specifically looked for an elderly dog. chambers fell in love with akira an older dog who had terminal cancer. chambers shared drawings on their social media accounts to show the gift that akira brought to their world and the lessons chambers learned. i wanted to learn discipline and learn how to take care of a dog without necessarily caring for a puppy chambers said. when chambers first visited the lifeline shelter they noticed akira because while other dogs were barking she remained quiet. it was a 180 degree turnaround once chambers got her home. she had too much life for an 8 year old pitbull with cancer they said. she had a lot of personality. she was a loud bold stubborn woman. although she was ill they noticed that when akira went for a walk she had boundless energy. she was

spotted a dead dog in the driveway. other larger dogs were milling about but a small chihuahua stopped him cold. she looked pitiful out there said gulley who has volunteered with a number of animal rescue groups. the owner planned to have her put down because she was old and sick. as best the vet could tell she was between 12 and 14 years old. her spine was severely damaged. part of her jaw was missing so her tongue protruded from her mouth. she was anemic dehydrated blind and her tiny body was battling an infection. today the dog named nola although still feeble has outlived predictions. she shares a dacula home with gulley a regional sales manager for a garage door opener company his wife vickie four other dogs and a cat. the pets are all senior rescues ranging in age from 8 to perhaps 14. the majority of people just want a pet said gulley. i didn t want them as pets. i wanted to take care of them. seniors are the most neglected and a lot of people don t want to deal with them. during a recent outing to their vacation home on lake hartwell gulley filled a pill organizer for nola who takes five medications daily. my heart just goes out to them gulley said. if we can get one dog adopted who needs it wow that would make a difference. they ve brought me so much joy. michael san filippo a spokesman for the american veterinary medical association said that due to improved veterinary care and dietary habits pets are living longer now than ever before. it s important to remember that age is not a disease good care allows our pets to live happy healthy and active lives in their senior years. it s difficult to say what the average life span of a dog is because it varies by size and breed as well as other factors such as whether the dog is spayed or neutered. chihuahuas for example have an average life span of about 15 years compared to great danes whose average life span is closer to 8 years. cats are a bit more consistent in size and age range with the average life expectancy of cats being somewhere around 15 years if they are indoors only cats cats that are allowed to roam outdoors have much shorter lifespans.

showed the border between haiti and the dominican republic which share the caribbean island of hispaniola. one side was lush and green the other yellow and dry. gross domestic product is 17000 per capita. haiti by contrast has a gdp of 20 billion a poverty rate of 60 percent 40 percent unemployment and gdp per capita of 1800. the only difference between the two countries is power frazier said.

smattering of light south korea well lit. that is the difference between countries that allow private enterprise like oil and gas producers the ability to operate without government control to innovate and be entrepreneurs he said. both speakers made the case that that not only will fossil fuels led by natural gas continue to be as much as 85 percent of the world s energy mix for the foreseeable future but that producing those fuels can address environmental concerns. iraq for example flared 632 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2019 more than the 578 bcf of gas burned by the state of california to create energy frazier noted. rather than fighting the rise of renewable energy he said the us should produce oil because the us can do it better and should transport that cleaner energy to africa asia and around the globe to make the world better. we have a situation where the ability to provide energy for our family is a challenge and a roadblock to success said gusek noting the situation is similar to the 1500s in great britain when wood was in such demand rural britons had difficulty affording it. energy gives us the resilience to change and adapt stated frazier. the power of a barrel of oil lets us change that oil. it buys us time lets us use our minds to make the world better. the barrels produced in the permian basin don t stay here he said instead finding their way around the globe. and local operators are helping advance technology to produce oil faster more efficiently and cleaner than ever before. for now frazier added that gives this region the

wednesday s energy shale conference illustrated the importance of access to power. shad frazier vice president operations at endeavor energy resources showed the border between haiti and the dominican republic which share the caribbean island of hispaniola. one side was lush and green the other yellow and dry. the dominican republic the lush green side had invested in its power infrastructure in 1960 and has a gross domestic product of 173 billion a 30 percent poverty rate and 5 percent unemployment. gross domestic product is 17000 per capita. haiti by contrast has a gdp of 20 billion a poverty rate of 60 percent 40 percent unemployment and gdp per capita of 1800. the only difference between the two countries is power frazier said. oil report exhibitors display latest in technology for reviving oil industry . ron gusek president of liberty oilfield services showed a slide of the two koreas at night north korea dark with only a smattering of light south korea well lit. that is the difference between countries that allow private enterprise like oil and gas producers the ability to operate without government control to innovate and be entrepreneurs he said. both speakers made the case that that not only will fossil fuels led by natural gas continue to be as much as 85 percent of the world s energy mix for the foreseeable future but that producing those fuels can address environmental concerns. iraq for example flared 632 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2019 more than the 578 bcf of gas burned by the state of california to create energy frazier noted. rather than fighting the rise of renewable energy he said the us should produce oil because the us can do it better and should transport that cleaner energy to africa asia and around the globe to make the world better. we have a situation where the ability to provide energy for our family is a challenge and a roadblock to success said gusek noting the situation is similar to the 1500s in great britain when wood was in such demand rural britons had difficulty affording it. energy gives us the resilience to change and adapt stated frazier. the power of a barrel of oil lets us change that oil. it buys us time lets us use our minds to make the world better. the barrels produced in the permian basin don t stay here he said instead finding their way around the globe. and local operators are helping advance technology to produce oil faster more efficiently and cleaner than ever before. for now frazier added that gives this region the opportunity to lift the world bring power to those without power. related report shows hiring continues in oilfield service sector . according to gusek million people die each year from breathing outdoor particulate matter likely from burning down forests to

education,"universities have been promising to fix the sector s gender problem for decades but women are still under represented at almost every level particularly in decision making roles among full professors and senior faculty positions and in the highest earning echelons. the globe and mail collected and analyzed public sector salary records in ontario going back to 1999 to better understand this lack of progress. ontario is the only jurisdiction that makes this historical data available. in total 15 of ontario s 21 universities were part of the review. affiliated colleges were not included. only universities that had at least 100 employees on the list as of 2009 could be included otherwise small staff fluctuations caused dramatic swings in the findings. in order to ensure a fair comparison between the years the globe adjusted for inflation during salary related analysis. when ontario passed the sunshine law in the 1990s it determined that only employees who earned 100000 would be subject to disclosure. that number hasn t changed but if it had moved with inflation the new threshold would be 147537 in 2019. in calculating data points such as overall representation the globe only captured employees who would qualify for disclosure if the threshold had kept pace with inflation. if this had not been done the situation would look much worse because women are concentrated in lower paying jobs. for transparency s sake the globe has provided both the inflation adjusted and non adjusted numbers in the overall representation and wage gap charts. many assistant and associate professors currently earn below 147537 in 2019 and could not have been included otherwise. it is likely many at the lowest teaching levels did not meet the disclosure threshold in 1999 in fact there were so few assistant and associate professors in 1999 we did not include them in the analysis. to gain a more complete picture of where the imbalances are the globe assessed 12 job titles in administrative leadership and academic roles president provost vice president vice provost associate vice president assistant vice president dean professor professor with additional responsibilities associate professor associate professor with additional responsibilities and assistant professor. provosts are often also vice presidents but because of their importance within the executive structure the globe analyzed them separately. when assessing professors and associate professors the globe took into account faculty members who were also listed as having additional duties such as department head assistant dean or research chair. this is what additional responsibilities means. read more about the globe s power gap methodology. the overall story is that two decades ago nine out of 10 university employees on the ontario sunshine list were men as were nine out of 10 professors nine out of 10 deans and three quarters of vice presidents. in the ensuing 20 years schools made notable progress hiring more women such that they now represent about one third of university staff. representation in leadership has also improved significantly though the bulk of new hires are concentrated in lower level less prestigious jobs. below you can see the situation at individual universities in ontario through the years. 1. this data was collected using ontario s sunshine list which includes employees who earn at least 100000. to make comparison possible the globe has indexed each year to 1999 dollars. in 2019 the equivalent is 147537. in the inflation adjusted data only employees who would qualify for the adjusted threshold are included.

labour,"cleveland ohio despite the half a million women who returned to the workforce in march many women particularly women of color are still struggling. childcare shortages and schools teaching

gained in april at least 500000 were women according to the bureau of labor statistics. despite this growth women are still struggling to reach pre pandemic levels of employment especially women of color said dena cipriano spokeswoman for the greater cleveland partnership. out of the 158 companies and approximately 187000 employees in northeast ohio women made up 60 of the workforce but only 38

displaced from their job or not it s made them stop and think about what they really want to do jones said. a lot of that has to do with the fact that they are taking care of their kids. jones said the stress put on women in the last year has caused many to reflect on their next steps as they navigate the workforce. i think there s so many levels in this for women jones said. jones noted

due to childcare sometimes also taking care of elderly parents all while balancing their careers. the hospital adopted a work from strategy to help its female employees balance their home life while maintaining their work. one of the things we learned from work from home is that we needed to be more flexible in how we think about the work that gets done at home aurilio said. aurilio said the hospital is more focused on the outcome and quality of the work not necessarily tying that to when that work is done. i think that s been one of the key things we ve done aurilio said. aurilio said akron children s is working to support women by normalizing the need for mental health care and providing resources for women to support their families without getting overlooked for leadership or

the pandemic said kathleen vegh associate vice president of global employee experience. she said very few female employees leave the company due to childcare related concerns in part because the westlake based software company views flexibility as a vital piece of its employee recruitment and retention activity. the company has its own childcare center on site. once covid intensified in the spring we re emphasized that flexibility to all our employees especially those facing unique situations at home vegh said. coupled with our core values and other accommodations we instituted for our employees we feel we ve created a culture where our working mothers could balance their new more complex home situations and their meaningful impactful work at hyland. firstenergy offered its

economy,"hgtv s renovation island follows the baeumlers as they renovate a caribbean resort. chances are however they spent more than you d imagine to get the job done. season 3 of renovation island is back and more entertaining than ever and along with fawning over all the new episodes fans are beginning to wonder just how much cash has gone into the renovation of caerula mar clu. after all as fun as sarah and bryan baeumler s island adventures may seem and as stunning as the results are it comes with a cost. and not one footed solely by hgtv we might add. as you may have seen in the promos for season 2 the baeumlers aren t just stressed about normal foreseen renovations of the resort which is located on the south shore of south andros. they re also coping with the effects of covid and hurricane dorian which struck the caribbean island just before covid 19 lockdowns and travel notices kicked into gear. together these two roadblocks made for more renovations and fewer visitors both of which meant more money sucked into the project. according to reports the baeumlers invested 10 million up front to renovate the island and transform the once rundown emerald palms resort into the chic caerula mar club. while this is undoubtedly a hefty penny two things must be kept in mind first before even appearing on hgtv and earning a wage from the network bryan touted a not too shabby net worth we re talking in the ballpark of 20 million . on top of that it s safe to say that he and sarah earned checks for their appearances on the show. it s unclear if hgtv paid for anything in the resort however it s safe to assume it costs a pretty hefty price tag to produce the show. according to a distractify article it reportedly costs anywhere from 45000 to 50000 to produce a single episode of house hunters. if you use that rate to guess a ballpark for renovation island on the high end we re looking at around 650000 per 13 episode season. even if the network does n t put anything directly into the resort they do of course pay the baeumlers. although their direct salaries are n t known the baeumlers are in a unique situation as renovation island is produced by bryland entertainment which is owned by bryan himself. this means that bryan has the opportunity to negotiate his and sarah s salary with hgtv himself potentially leading to even higher wages. all this to say even though he and sarah invested millions of dollars in securing the land and materials necessary to bring their caribbean dream resort to life the couple is able to replenish their funds with hefty seasonal checks.

arts,"calling it a great day for taxpayers the homer township board voted unanimously monday to drop its lawsuit against the village of homer glen. the former homer township board filed the lawsuit in december claiming the village was unlawfully trying to seize the property and assets of the homer township road district. former township road district commissioner mike devivo negotiated with homer glen on a transfer of stewardship that gave control of the road district s property to the village which created its first public works department. the previous township board under former supervisor pam meyers sought to stop the transfer of equipment and assets but will county circuit judge john c. anderson ruled april 7 in favor of the village and road district. the township board then appealed the circuit court s decision. meyers and her slate of candidates lost their reelection bids april 6 to will county board member steve balich and his slate of candidates who were seated last month. meyers said at the time that she filed the appeal to keep the case alive while the newly elected village and township boards decided how to proceed. the transfer of assets took place april 19 but the litigation was still ongoing and a village attorney said the appellate court likely wouldn t make a decision until next year. under the transfer the village would leave the township some trucks and smaller equipment necessary to maintain 18 miles of unincorporated roads and the village would reasonably share equipment with the township road district. homer township supervisor balich said monday residents of homer glen and homer township are the winners. balich said the former township board spent at least 18000 on the lawsuit but he is unsure of the final cost of the litigation. the village of homer glen and homer township have spent a boatload of money on lawyer fees balich said. i didn t immediately close it out because i wanted to make sure that the village of homer glen was willing to work with us on what we need. the village of homer glen is working with us. balich pledged that the township and the village will work together. we all have the same taxpayers balich said. we all have to do whatever it takes to bring down the cost of government. i don t like spending money unnecessarily. homer glen mayor george yukich agreed. we both agree there is no reason to fight over the road district and spend any more money yukich said. we are working together to make sure the village and the township do what s right for all of our residents. recent homer glen documents show that the village spent about 67000 on attorney fees related to the road district since august 2020. since homer glen incorporated as a village in 2001 the township road district had been maintaining 135 miles of homer glen roads through intergovernmental agreements and homer glen taxpayers have contributed to the cost of the equipment. the township road district also maintains 18 miles of roads in the unincorporated areas of the township.

unrest,"while it s no secret that small businesses have encountered considerable hardship due to closures and restrictions associated with the covid 19 pandemic some business owners are remaining optimistic and finding ways to continue fostering communities. for kevin allan and dannah melad what started as a mission to make the best gluten free cookies possible blossomed into vanilla bite bakery an online bakery they run right out of their apartment. the pair had initially started off making cookies for allan s father who has celiac disease. starting their business in january during the pandemic posed some unique challenges allan says but the two have still strived to foster relationships with their customers. we wanted to treat every customer with the same level of care like we treated my father he says adding building a strong community was always a priority for them. according to allan vanilla bite chose to bypass delivery apps completely in order to have a more direct relationship with their customers. instead they started going through people they knew as well as working with other businesses and instagram influencers. it s not just some random contractor from doordash who leaves it at the door and walks away. we actually have a dedicated employee who s invested in the business who cares about our customers and who just happens to be very sociable says allan. melad adds she has also connected with online business communities to learn more about growing the bakery and has partnered with other local businesses on their orders when possible. the universe has really how 3 small businesses pivoted in the pandemic . like melad and allan alessia peluso opened up her caf emily rose cafe during the pandemic. according to peluso the caf is named after both of her grandmothers one of whom ran a restaurant for almost 50 years. my life has revolved around food my family always revolved around food it s like our love language so i wanted to do something on a smaller scale she says. the hardships she faced opening her business during the pandemic included pivoting and adjusting to ongoing changes in covid 19 regulations says peluso. it was a little difficult at times because there was never really a clear message of what we re able to do and not to do it was really changing. on a more positive note peluso says the struggles she faced created a sense of community for small businesses. being tucked away in a residential neighbourhood the support she immediately got from neighbours was heartwarming. we were lucky enough that people could still come in and grab stuff people working from home would come in and they could chat with you for two to five minutes while you re making their coffee says peluso. i think that was a real positive considering everything going on you could still build relationships. having small talk with local customers as well as learning people s names and their orders has blossomed into relationships which is amazing she says. the strain on family businesses during covid 19 . danish yusef ceo of zensurance says the impact on small businesses has varied from industry to industry. according to yusef the ones that have been struggling the most include small coffee shops nail salons and plumbing businesses many of which have shut down during covid 19. on the flip side more white collar jobs like the consultants the engineers lawyers paralegals they ve actually seen their business increase quite a bit he says. what we are now seeing with this mixed space of are we opening are we not opening is there s a lot of uncertainty which causes stress to the business owner. yusef adds they had lots of demand from owners for insurance after losing money during periods of closures. many restaurants for example bought more furniture ahead of preparing to reopen only for ontario to shut down again he says. restaurants have been particularly hard hit he says. food has been the hardest hit from an insurance standpoint particularly where they serve liquor. when it comes to advice for business owners on reopening yusef says there is a lot of uncertainty particularly about what the demand will be like for restaurants and stores. more than 200k small businesses could close permanently amid pandemic cfib . for business owners it s just a matter of how certain you are that if you put in 20000 of investments that your particular style of business will reopen. there s that aspect of whether you want to invest or not he says. additionally yusef says noting the modified behaviour of consumers ordering online is also important to consider. you have to determine how much of that modified behaviour is going to impact you and whether or not you dabble in that new world of demand he says pointing to an example of a hair salon that started doing hair treatment lessons via zoom. the online demand also means businesses can compete and serve customers from around the world he adds. for those who have opened a business during the pandemic yusef says there are countless examples of companies that started when times were tough and ended up becoming big. many people have started businesses in virtual health care in remote care services in food delivery there are a lot of opportunities. so if you re looking to start a business it could be a fantastic time he says. and there s a lot of capital available to support people. you need to have the right business and the right pitch but there s so much capital available to fund good ideas. according to derek hopfner director of revenue at ownr the percentage of new food and service restaurants bars caf s businesses relative to other business categories jumped 175 per cent. what this means hopfner says is entrepreneurs are planning for the future and being proactive. looking through a macro lens of the food and beverage lens specifically hopfner says it shows there s a pent up demand being anticipated amongst canadians who are looking to spend on tourism food and beverage when it s safe to do so. i think there s a general excitement in the community to get out of our houses and meet up with friends and family and share food and conversation in a public space where we ve all been bubbled up over the last 14 months he says. globally i think it is a shift to realizing the importance of these types of businesses to regain a sense of community. canadian businesses owned by women taking nearly twice as long to recover from covid 19 . these entrepreneurs are starting a business to foster that sense of community says hopfner adding post pandemic things like restaurants are a vital part of a vibrant and inclusive environment. we re all really excited to see what post pandemic life looks like and we re also appreciative and reliant on the small business community he says. they employ so many individuals and are really a core of the community that we re all looking to create again. allan says looking forward he s thrilled about meeting customers in person and opening up a physical store. opening a business during the peak lockdown in january i feel like it puts us in a unique position to help toronto come out of this he says. coronavirus is hurting small businesses. peluso adds restaurants and those in the service industry have continued to pivot and find creative ways to adapt. it s really amazing to see how people quickly adapt. and i think that s going to create a lot of innovation in the future for restaurants and small businesses because we ve had to change so many things from our original planning she says. additionally peluso hopes that when businesses start to reopen customers will show respect and gratitude towards workers. it s a lot on your mental health to cater to people to take care of people but also keep everybody safe to follow all the protocols she says. despite all the difficulties caused by the pandemic peluso says the positivity and sense of community have been incredible to experience. there s been a huge sense of community a huge sense of support for small businesses and that s very endearing to see.

labour,"the eu court of justice has backed aspects of claims by 6000 tesco employees regarding equal pay . the supreme court had already similarly upheld the claims of 44000 asda workers on the same issue . by matteo castia . the court of justice of the european union on thursday recognized the legitimacy of claims brought forward by some employees of tesco plc in their dispute with the british grocer regarding equal pay. the group of around 6000 tesco current or former staff have claimed the retail giant has n t been paying men and women equally at its premises. the lawsuit arrived at the eu court of justice after the group of employees took their case to a tribunal in watford england. the female claimants in the main proceedings submit that their work and that of the male workers employed by tesco stores in the distribution centers in its network are of equal value and that they are entitled to compare their work and that of those workers the court said. the grocer s position is that the jobs in its stores and distribution centers are different hence the different pay and that the eu law provisions the claimants refer to are n t directly effective in the context of claims based on work of equal value. these roles require different skills and demands which lead to variations in pay but this has absolutely nothing to do with gender a tesco spokesperson told the wall street journal. the court backed the claimants views on the case stating that the grocer should be seen as a single entity in terms of employment conditions and referring to the principle of work of equal value. the court said that where the differences identified in the pay conditions of workers performing equal work or work of equal value can be attributed to a single source the work and the pay of those workers can be compared even if they work in different establishments. the principle laid down by eu law of equal pay for male and female workers can be relied upon directly in respect both of equal work and of work of equal value the court said. this specific ruling is n t a judgment on the claims against tesco as the court s pronunciation represents a decision on whether the eu test for comparability of two different roles based in different establishments but within one organization applies directly to private businesses in the uk. with its thursday statement the court established that these provisions do apply directly to private businesses in the in accordance with the country s brexit deal with the eu. equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue but private sector businesses ca n t assume they re immune particularly as social media is now used to recruit claimants for mass claims and crowdfunding can be used to fund them law firm howard kennedy partner jane amphlett said in march when asda group ltd. found itself involved in a similar case. at that time the british retailer was taken to the supreme court by 44000 employees seeking compensation on the basis that in the six year period prior to commencing proceedings in 2014 they had received less pay than a valid comparator for the same work. again lower paid shop staff mostly women argued that they could compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers mostly men. on that occasion shop floor workers were supported by labor union gmb which had members involved in the case. on march 26 the supreme court upheld the retail employees view as well as an earlier ruling against which asda had appealed. the essential question on this appeal was whether common terms apply between the claimants and comparator s establishments satisfying the common terms requirement in the equal pay legislation the supreme court said at the time. asda had taken a position similar to tesco s saying the pay gap was dictated by the different nature of the two jobs rather than by gender as there was a substantial difference between the two divisions. the pay in our stores and distribution centers is the same for colleagues doing the same jobs regardless of their gender. retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and pay rates an asda spokesperson told the wall street journal at the time. the supreme court had also made clear that its ruling did n t mean the claimants had won the right to equal pay as the decision just paved the way for them to take further action. however as ms. amphlett noted back in march the supreme court may had started a path that could well end up with a multimillion pound bill for asda. write to matteo castia at .

economy,"the bay area economy muscled up to produce solid job gains in may that topped those of april but the region s employment totals remain far below where they were before coronavirus linked shutdowns began. the job gains last month in the bay area were powered by big increases in employment in the east bay the south bay and the san francisco san mateo region the state s labor agency reported friday. the bay area added 16500 jobs in may which was slightly better than the employment increases in april when the region gained 15900 jobs according to a report from the employment development department. the east bay added 4600 jobs the south bay gained 3900 positions and the san francisco san mateo metro region added 6000 jobs the edd reported. california added 104500 jobs during may according to the edd. the statewide unemployment rate improved slightly to in may compared with 8 in april. california continues to lead the nation s economic recovery adding 104500 jobs in may marking the fourth month in a row of six figure job creation gov. gavin newsom said friday in a prepared release. despite the governor s declaration the road to full economic recovery for california and the bay area must navigate a forbidding landscape. the bay area all of its metro centers as well as california all face a daunting task to recover the jobs these regions lost in epic numbers during march and april of 2020 when wide ranging business shutdowns were imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus. california during those two months lost a jaw dropping million jobs but regained only million of those positions from may 2020 through may 2021. that leaves california with a jobs recovery deficit of million jobs. similarly the bay area lost a stunning 638600 jobs during the two dreadful months of march and april 2020 but has recouped only 277800 of those jobs from may 2020 through may 2021. that leaves the bay area 360800 jobs short of what the region lost.

religion,"people are giving more consideration to insurance cover especially since the advent of the covid 19 pandemic says zurich international life in the middle east zurich in a report. its 2021 customer benefits paid report revealed that with covid 19 the major health story of 2020 the pandemic has had a marked effect on people s behaviour towards financial protection. in terms of the biggest threats to life heart attacks and strokes were the biggest risk 43 per cent followed by cancer 27 per cent and accidents 10 per cent . covid 19 while a relatively new illness was responsible for 5 per cent of all life insurance claims reveals the report. cancer led the list of the gravest critical illness risks followed by heart attacks various chronic conditions and strokes. a split by gender reveals that heart attacks were the lead critical illness insurance claim for males 53 per cent while only 5 per cent of females claimed for the same condition. cancer led the female benefit claims list 85 per cent with the illness accounting for only 31 per cent of benefit claims for males. according to a yougov survey commissioned by zurich only 22 per cent of respondents felt financially prepared for unfortunate family events. interestingly more male respondents per cent felt somewhat well prepared compared to per cent of women who felt the same. across all age categories more than half of respondents said that due to covid 19 they were somewhat likely or extremely likely to consider purchasing life or critical illness cover with more than per cent of respondents aged 18 34 saying they purchased life insurance since the start of the global crisis. people in the middle east are also paying increased attention to the benefits of a healthier lifestyle with many taking up exercise yoga and other physical and mental wellbeing activities in a bid to reduce or mitigate the risks of developing long term serious illness. this is especially prescient when considering that the report reveals of the total amount paid in benefits the split between critical illness and life insurance claims was almost equal. this demonstrates that while people are actually living longer more and more people are contracting critical illnesses and dealing with the associated financial impact of managing chronic conditions. another import trend to consider is that while there has been an increase in the number of people with pre existing conditions seeking the financial security of insurance protection zurich is still accepting 99 per cent of applications for cover. the report shows that 12 per cent of applicants were shown to be overweight with per cent having raised blood sugar levels which can lead to long term serious conditions. given the role of females as key decision makers when it comes to household finances it is noteworthy that women tended to find life insurance too expensive to purchase compared to men. of those surveyed per cent of women said they don t have insurance because it is too expensive compared to 34 per cent of men who lacked cover for the same reason. walter jopp ceo of zurich in the middle east said this report demonstrates that while people are living longer many of us may have to contend with a life threatening situation at some point in the future. this is why it s important to be prepared and to consider all options whether that be the potential of contracting a serious illness or even death. our survey shows that 37 per cent of respondents don t have life or critical illness cover because they deem it too expensive however people might be surprised to learn we have a range of flexible and affordable cover options. for instance we ve launched yourlife and yourcare which are instant simple and accessible solutions with protection starting from just aed2 per day. at zurich we are committed to helping provide financial security and assurance to families whatever the circumstances. we are proud to have paid per cent of life insurance claim payments amounting to a total of 136 million in customer benefits between january 2018 and december 2020. richa bhagari a zurich customer from dubai said that being diagnosed with cancer in august 2020 was one of the most challenging periods of her life. the 45 year old happily married entrepreneur and mother of one said that the treatment was not only painful but both physically and mentally draining. she revealed the secret to coping was to have a positive outlook be it in business or in life. you have to train your mind to be optimistic place mind over matter and take things in your stride. my learning from this experience is to be secure to be protected financially physically mentally and spiritually. be ready for life. tradearabia news service .'

labour,"washington ap the biden administration said thursday it is moving to increase the pay and union rights for security screeners at the nation s airports. the department of homeland security directed the acting head of the transportation security administration to come up with a plan within 90 days to raise the pay of the screeners and expand their rights to collective bargaining. the change reflects the more labor friendly approach of president joe biden granting a long standing goal of workers at an agency created to improve airport security after the attacks of sept. lower pay and benefits than other federal workers has contributed to morale problems and high turnover among the nation s 46000 tsa workers who were excluded from the general schedule pay scale and personnel system of most other federal workers when the agency was set up as a component of dhs. the american federation of government employees and members of congress have long pushed legislation that would put tsa officers on par with the rest of the federal workforce. we are just asking to be put on the same scale as everyone else. we are not asking for something different said hydrick thomas president of afge s council 100 which represents tsa officers nationwide. starting annual pay for tsa officers is 35000 39000 and tops out at 43000. an employee of customs and border protection at the same airport would make 60000 80000 after six years and have significantly better retirement and other benefits said thomas who is also an officer at john f. kennedy airport in new york city. the tsa are front line workers too he said. every day we put the uniform on we put ourselves in harm s way. with the actions being taken by the biden administration tsa officers still wo n t be on equal footing with other federal workers. when congress set up the tsa it granted the agency administrator broad authority over the procedures discipline and compensation of the workforce. that is n t changing with the directive announced thursday. in the memo laying out the administrative actions mayorkas said tsa officers pay should be no less than their counterparts in the federal workforce. they will be granted new access to grievance procedures but their collective bargaining rights would only closely mirror those provided under law to other federal employees. mayorkas said he has directed the acting tsa administrator to work with the american federation of government employees on a new collective bargaining agreement with the non supervisory members of the workforce. it will be similar to other federal agencies but the new agreement will preserve tsa s ability to meet its critical security mission he said without providing further details. a bill in congress which has twice before passed the house but not been considered by the senate would put tsa officers in the general schedule along with other federal workers give them access to an independent third party for dispute resolution and ensure the measures being taken under biden could not be undone by a new administration. federal employees do not have the right to strike. one of the legislation s authors rep. bennie thompson a mississippi democrat who chairs the homeland security committee said the new action by the biden administration is significant progress but is n t sufficient. tsa frontline officers have been grossly underpaid and denied basic workplace rights for far too long he said.

other,"british columbia and washington state are joining forces for a cross border effort to find and eradicate asian giant hornet nests this summer. sometimes called murder hornets the insects are an invasive species native to east and south asia that threaten to destroy honey bee colonies which are important for bc and washington s agriculture industries. both jurisdictions are laying out traps for the asian giant hornets to detect where they re living and lead investigators back to their nests to destroy them. officials are asking citizen scientists on both sides of the border to lay out their own simple pop bottle style traps and contact the appropriate agency in bc or washington if they spot an unusually large hornet. we would like to use the public s eyes to report sightings because we don t have enough resources to be everywhere all the time sven erik spichiger managing entomologist with the washington state department of agriculture said at a wednesday news conference. officials suggest using a mixture of water and brown sugar to attract the insects but orange juice grape juice and rice wine will also work. after being spotted for the first time in bc in 2019 and several more times on both sides of the border last summer scientists and agricultural officials say the pressure is on to eradicate the invasive insect before it establishes itself in the pacific northwest. the hornets are known to attack honey bees and will slaughter entire colonies in a matter of hours by decapitating the bees. then they ll take over the bee colony as their own and eat the young. they threaten to cause untold damage to the pacific northwest s beekeeping industry which will in turn make it more difficult to grow certain types of produce the lower mainland is known for such as blueberries. the hornets nest in the ground and will aggressively defend their home if disturbed. paul van westendorp bc s provincial apiculturist recounted how a nest was found in nanaimo in 2019 that was next to a public park and walkway. if a dog or child had sniffed the nest they could have been attacked. if there s direct exposure to you of a hornet s nest absolutely there is danger to your health and well being. he added the hornets are an apex predator and they will kill other native species of wasps and hornets. eliminating those middle predators could upset the insect ecosystem leading to more types of unwanted bugs here. officials believe the hornets were introduced via marine traffic coming into one of bc or washington s ports. they suspect a young queen could have insulated herself in a shipping container or vehicle and emerged here in the spring to set up a new nest. they added more invasive species could be introduced this way in the future. van westendorp believes the fraser valley is the most attractive ecosystem for the asian giant hornets and doesn t think they ll establish themselves in bc s evergreen forests or further east in the interior. that s why he s particularly focused on asking bc beekeepers to monitor for the hornets. with consistent predation from humans in the form of trapping and extermination van westendorp hopes asian giant hornets can be brought under control this year. last year in bc there were six confirmed sightings of asian giant hornets. south of the border washington state reported 31 confirmed sightings plus at least 500 insects found at a nest that was destroyed. spichiger shared a map of the traps planted for this summer where the focus is near previous sightings in places such as whatcom skagit san juan island jefferson and clallam counties birch bay custer and blaine. washington state department of agriculture . he believes putting out a trap is in people s best interest because it s safer to know in advance if there are asian giant hornets in your area rather than unwittingly disturbing a nest. this is not a species that we want to tolerate here in the us and certainly not in washington state spichiger """

unrest,"for the 11 days israeli air strikes pummelled gaza dr khamis would try to take a two hour nap around 8am the only time he could catch some much needed rest. israel would carpet bomb different areas of the strip at roughly 11pm every night when there was no electricity in most parts of gaza city. the kids would cry and scream. the huge supersonic explosions spread a lot of fear among the children he recalls. the darkness increased their terror major infrastructure including electricity and also roads and water supplies were damaged by strikes. at night there is nowhere to escape to. during the daytime at least they can seek refuge in another room or on the staircase. dr khamis elessi is a palestinian neuro rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant who has lived in different parts of the world before returning home to gaza. he studied and worked in the philippines sheba medical centre in tel aviv southampton and oxford in the uk. he says that of all the five previous military confrontations he has lived through this was undoubtedly the worst. roughly 260 people lost their lives including 68 children. many of them died whilst they were sleeping he says. they were just crushed under the ceiling of their building. dr khamis spent his days following up with his medical students online that is if they had the electricity to be able to log in and listen sometimes helping patients over the phone or tending to the wounded at shifa hospital. most of the time i tried to psychologically and spiritually support my nuclear and extended family members which totalled more than 70 individuals in one night he says. on the seventh day of the escalation the situation took a turn for the worse. the israeli army spokesman announced that in less than one hour 160 military aeroplanes dropped 450 missiles onto the eastern and northern side of the gaza strip. everyone inside our building was screaming and frozen inside his or her body but there was no time for me to cry or feel scared he recounts. while his family were listening to these gigantic explosions his daughter a final year physiotherapist fainted and collapsed with clenched mouth and cyanosed lips. because of the fear she had n t eaten for five days. with very limited light dr. khamis spent more than 30 minutes helping her regain full consciousness and tried to put two tablespoons of honey into her mouth. all the kids and his mother were crying. before she fully regained consciousness one of my nieces fainted because of the commotion he recalls. fifteen minutes after i revived her a second niece fainted then a third. i asked my wife and stepsister to do to them like what i did to the others. the time by then was 5am so i was completely exhausted and went to take a nap for 10 20 minutes. dr khamis never had the opportunity to take his nap because as he collapsed into a chair he heard screaming from his brother s house next door. his niece had given birth to her first baby just a few hours ago and when she heard the fresh round of bombing she also collapsed and was convulsing. at that moment i had the feeling of being completely helpless because you ca n t do anything to protect your kids or family he says. during wars this is a typical day for us here in gaza. for some respite palestinians living in gaza would often head to the long stretch of coast on the mediterranean to relax. however because israel bombed the sewage system and there is no electricity local municipalities have been forced to push sewage into the sea. so now the only refuge for the people to seek leisure time has been banned because the sea is now highly polluted with sewage water says dr. khamis. there are two main parks on the strip but they are barely big enough for 1000 of the million people who live in gaza he added. during the offensive more than 2000 residential units were totally destroyed including seven towers. unfortunately our healthcare system has been on the verge of collapse for the last 15 years because of the ongoing siege on gaza from air land and sea. but still we have the right to live like any other citizen worldwide with free access to healthcare. a grainy surveillance video released last week captured the targeting of al remal clinic gaza s main covid 19 laboratory. it shows patients and staff running as smoke fills the corridors until eventually you can see nothing but a grey cloud. just before the war gaza had managed to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections which were down from 1000 1500 a day to 200 a day. several medics feared cases would rise again as thousands of palestinians sought refuge in unrwa schools and each other s homes but fortunately they have n t. dr. khamis now thinks that gaza has almost reached herd immunity. before the air strikes there was already a shortage of medicine and medical staff. roughly 65 per cent of children under the age of five and women at childbearing age are anaemic because of the lack of fresh vegetables available and almost million people of the gaza strip s total population are refugees who rely on regular food assistance from international humanitarian organisations. palestinian children hold candles during a rally amid the ruins of houses destroyed by israeli strikes in gaza city on may 24 2021. slogans in arabic reads stop the crimes of the occupation of palestine mohammed abed afp via getty images . a 2012 report found that 92 per cent of children in gaza suffer from ptsd. i think this percentage might have now reached per cent says dr khamis. the situation here is really miserable. i think not only children but every palestinian in gaza needs psychological counselling and treatment. dr. khamis lost two colleagues and friends in the strikes head of internal medicine dr. ayman abu al ouf who was killed at home along with his wife and all members of his family and also his sister with all of her family members. also killed on the same night was dr. moein aloul a neurologist. aloul was also killed along with his family and four other families who were completely crushed under the roof of their homes in six apartments in one block during air strikes that hit al wehda in the early hours of the morning leaving a total of 46 killed and more than 100 individuals injured. meet the palestinian building preschools to help children to survive and thrive . now 13 days after the ceasefire palestinians have taken a deep sigh of relief says dr. khamis finally there is no more bombing and shelling and we hope this will last for good. palestinians have started to clear rubble from the streets and move parts of the demolished buildings to clear the way for cars to pass through. they also started removing the broken glass and debris from the different hospitals and clinics including al remal clinic which hopes to be back on its feet and serving the community very soon. gaza has received unprecedented global pledges that still need to be followed through on including from the us with a total of billion pledged. if that materialises gaza will become a state of the art city. even if one third of these pledges reach gaza it would be possible to build new homes and buildings for all those that lost their homes says dr. khamis. however we do n t just need reconstruction medicine and food for now and then the international community to just forget about the root cause which is the ongoing israeli siege and occupation of palestinian land and the non stop israeli settlers and police incitements against muslims in jerusalem and sheikh jarrah. i always advise relatives friends students and colleagues that we have to remain positive in our thoughts and our expectations as well because without it we will die he continues. many people ask me this question when i keep saying be positive we still have hope and things will be better why do you feel optimistic all the time i tell them it s because hope for a better tomorrow is the only thing we have and it is the only thing we will have for sure and without hope we will die without hope you will find me dead.

social,a majority of area respondents say they support the way the city of minneapolis is reclaiming george floyd square according to a free press online question. out of 254 total respondents 221 voters more than 87 say they agree with the way minneapolis is handling the situation. another 33 voters opposed the city s actions. minneapolis workers and some community members removed concrete barriers on thursday at 38th street and chicago avenue the intersection where george floyd was killed by minneapolis police. the area known as george floyd square had been closed by community members last year after floyd s murder. the area was open to traffic for a bit thursday morning before community members put up new barriers. while some residents and businesses have urged the city to reopen the intersection others say the area should remain a permanent memorial to floyd. city officials say they plan to keep one of the statues at the square as a monument. minneapolis mayor jacob frey said the city plans to keep artwork at the area and ensure the location where floyd died never has tires run over it again the associated press reported. the free press online question sent out friday asked do you agree with the way the city of minneapolis reclaimed the intersection at george floyd square . commenters largely agreed the city was right to reopen george floyd square though some commenters took issue with how other commenters described the people who shut down the intersection. some commenters described the broad coalition of protesters who demonstrated after floyd s death as a black mob and called the black lives matter movement a racist terrorist organization despite the movement s aim to bring to light systemic racism in policing fiscal policy and other avenues of society. the city did the right thing should had been done a year ago william ulrich said. it s time to clean up the black mob. i would agree but not for the racist by definition of what it really is reasons given below paul brandon wrote. the problem is that there is no clear single representative of the neighborhood community. lacking that it s a public thoroughfare and should be maintained as such for the whole minneapolis community. a monument consistent with this use is clearly appropriate. beverly stoufer wrote yes it is time to open but what communication was done with the community this lack of communication transparency and involvement tends to be a continuous problem. timothy berg wrote as a young minister of the gospel i preached a sermon way back in 1974 with the basic premise that god loves all persons unconditionally regardless of skin color and that jesus lived that credo out in his life by loving and ministering to one and all. within one week in response to that sermon i received death threats aimed not only at me but at my wife and our 4 year old daughter. almost a half century later i had hoped that god s love and word might have softened a great many hearts on the question of racism in our country but after reading several of the comments on this topic i am sadly afraid i may have been overly hopeful.

social,transgender rights activist and celebrity publicist yaya mavundla has reached a new milestone in her journey. she has now been legally recognised as a woman after she was granted a new id number by the department of home affairs. taking to instagram mavundla announced the news to her followers on wednesday saying i received my new id number that identifies me as female. so much is about to happen for us transgender people. we are one step closer i encourage more trans people to go apply. she applied for her new id number in november last year and was given a few hassles by home affairs when they first told her they would n t be able to assist her as she didn t have a copy of her mother s id whom she never got a chance to meet. they told me they wouldn t be able to assist me without one and i said no that s fine. if you guys are saying you cannot assist me then i m more than happy to take this matter to court. i want justice not just for myself but for many other trans people as well she said. mavundla was then advised that she could get an affidavit stating that she does not have those documents. this then assisted her towards the next step. if they had been adamant that they would n t assist me i would have been more than happy to take the matter to court said mavundla. born and bred in kranskop a small town in kwazulu natal mavundla who comes from a largely rural background said she s always wanted trans visibility so this breakthrough speaks to the people who come from such spaces. she started her activism work on lgbti communities when she joined the durban lesbian and gay community health centre as a youth leader from 2009 to 2011. when she began the process of getting a new id number so she can apply for one she realised it was not an easy journey. i realised that after having started the process last year with home affairs it is certainly not an easy process for the average person sitting at home. being on television and being in the public eye helped me get the process done. i had access to many people at home affairs through the show but can you imagine a person who does not have access who needs to join a queue and stand there for hours and deal with the attitude given by home affairs officials . while i m grateful and happy that this is now happening for me i m not fully excited because i m now thinking what then happens to a trans person who does not have that access she said. she added that many factors come into play for trans people who want to be legally granted the gender recognition they wish. i was asked to provide a copy of my mother s id so if i ve never had the opportunity to meet my mother where then do i get a copy of her id what then happens to a trans who does not have a relationship at all with their parents because of their gender where then does this leave us . while she hasn t applied for her id document yet her new id number reflects that she is female and she will now be able to apply for it in the capacity of being a woman. when you apply for one an id it is treated as a replacement of the old one. it s almost as though you have lost your id and you are off to get a new one she said. on what more needs to be done mavundla said we need to get the government to get more work done. many south africans pay tax so that the work can be done. we don t pay tax to get load shedding we don t pay tax to struggle when we need to go to the clinic or a government hospital. if we are not getting those services it means the government is not at work. so we need to put pressure on the government for these services to be granted to us she said. according to pierre brouard acting director at the centre for sexualities aids and gender at the university of pretoria people have for quite a while now been able to change their gender marker on their identity document and that requires you to get a new identity number because currently how our identity numbers work is that they signify whether you re male or female. obviously for a trans person who doesn t identify with the sex assigned at birth it is distressing and according to our legal system people are now allowed to legally change their gender marker. the system also allows you to change your name as well so that it aligns with your chosen or new identity he said. according to him the challenge presented in a number of spheres is that there is a gap in terms of the starting application process and actually the changes being made. it can take a couple of years in some instances. in effect you are living in some kind of limbo because you are presenting in the world your gender identity but your id presents your assigned gender. and so your workplace systems operate off your legal identity. access is also a big issue where not everyone has access to these systems. it s one thing to have a law in place. it s another to have access to those legal systems to your personal advantage said brouard. on what more needs to be done he believes issues concerning people of the lgbti need to be handled with sensitivity. trans issues are spoken about in a way that is for click bait where they are salacious disrespectful and demeaning to people. and i think presenting trans issues in a way that is thoughtful and respectful would be part of the solution she said.

on saturday critically injuring several riders before police chased down the driver and shot him outside a nearby hardware store police said. phoenix ap bicyclist tony quinones had only just shaken hands with a fellow cyclist and wished him good luck in this weekend s community race in an arizona mountain town when a truck sped into a crowd of bike riders about six minutes into the race. the sounds of breaking and smashing as the truck plowed through the cyclists on saturday was quickly replaced by their groans of pain including those of the cyclist quinones had just met. authorities in the small city of show low said the unidentified 35 year old male suspect fled the crash scene in the pickup and was shot by officers a short time later. six riders were hospitalized in critical condition and the suspect was in critical but stable condition. quinones 55 said the man he had met was a fellow new mexican and that blood was flowing from his head and his nose. authorities were trying to determine why the man driving the truck rammed into the group of cyclists participating in the annual 58 mile 93 kilometer bike the bluff race that drew hundreds of participants. he was shot by police nearby outside a hardware store in show low which is about a three hour drive northeast of phoenix. we don t know the motivation said show low city spokeswoman grace payne. quinones said some cyclists wondered at first whether the driver of the truck had fallen asleep at the wheel. but quinones said he saw the man accelerate toward the cyclists. of the six cyclists hospitalized four were in critical condition and the two others were in critical but stable condition as of saturday. one was flown for treatment to a hospital near phoenix. witnesses said helmets shoes and crumpled and broken bicycles were strewn across the street after the crash and a tire was wedged into the grill of the truck that rammed the cyclists at about 7 25 in downtown show low. the truck had damage to its top and sides and a bullet hole in a window. this has been a horrible event police spokeswoman kristine sleighter said in a statement. our community is shocked at this incident and our hearts and prayers are with the injured and their families at this time. after the truck s driver hit a telephone pole cyclists ran up to the truck and started pounding on the windows screaming at the driver to get out. instead of stopping quinones said the driver hit the accelerator and backed out drove down the road made a u turn and then headed back toward the cyclists but did not hit them again and drove away. payne said the driver did not comply when officers tried to arrest him but the circumstances of the shooting were not immediately made public. juneteenth to become america s 12th federal holiday

environmental,"concerns among some residents about safety in a dimly lit community and a desire by others for the serenity of a starry night are putting many gladers on opposite sides of an issue of whether there should be more street lights. some say the safety of residents should require more lights especially in a community dominated by older people who have difficulty seeing at night and have greater fear of crime. the issue came to light in march after the fairfield glade community club board of directors sent an email blast written by the board s environment committee to residents explaining the consequences of light pollution. light pollution is artificial light that inappropriately shines on neighbors properties and illuminates the sky. the committee also shared outdoor lighting principles promoted by the international dark sky association which strives to protect the night sky from light pollution. residents quickly chimed in. some say the safety of residents should require more lights especially in a community dominated by older people who have difficulty seeing at night and have greater fear of crime. some in favor of dark skies note that fairfield glade is a rural community in the mountains and that people who move here should understand that this isn t the city. the issue came to light in march after the fairfield glade community club board of directors sent an email blast written by the board s environment committee to residents explaining the consequences of light pollution. light pollution is artificial light that inappropriately shines on neighbors properties and illuminates the sky. the committee also shared outdoor lighting principles promoted by the international dark sky association which strives to protect the night sky from light pollution. the issue has been a hot topic of debate on the social media site nextdoor where there are hundreds of comments from dozens of fairfield glade residents favoring or opposing more street lighting. one such resident ken snyder sees the need for safety but also for aesthetics and he hopes the community can achieve a good balance with a solution that benefits both sides. while he favors fewer street lights he said he understands that some people want more lights to feel safer. but he said street lights are just one strategy toward that end and that there are others such as reflective road lines and motion detectors on properties that also would allow residents to revere the night. it s really important for everyone to understand the needs of others snyder said in a telephone interview with the sun. unless we begin with an expressed empathic appreciation for the valid needs of others we re starting behind the 8 ball. some did. wedgworth said in an email to the sun that over the past month the board heard from several residents about the issue. he declined to release further details and said the board had no additional comments beyond its monthly may 20 magnified email newsletter in which it was said there are no plans to add street lights. but it identified eight intersections on peavine rd. where volunteer energy cooperative is to install street lights upon completion of the sr 101 peavine rd. expansion project. the board also wrote that it reviewed data from the glade s police department and found no reports involving automobile accidents pedestrian injuries or burglaries where streetlights would have prevented those types of incidents. police chief mike williams said the board asked for information on those three types of reports for certain neighborhoods going back two years. the department gave the board its data on all incidents not just of those three categories which included automobile crash data going back only one year. williams said in the past that street lights had been installed in areas where lack of lighting could have contributed to incidents such as traffic accidents and such incidents have happened one or two times in the six years i ve been here. the board said the glade has 290 street lights 46 at major intersections and 244 in various neighborhoods. although there are no plans to add street lights the board left open the possibility that there could be fewer going forward depending on safety considerations. in the future when a streetlight in a neighborhood burns out it will be reviewed for safety concerns if no safety concerns are found to exist the affected streetlight could be removed the board wrote. the board said future magnified newsletters will explain how residents can safely light homes for protection and enjoy dark skies. they also are to provide recommendations for how to walk pets on streets at night.

lifestyle,"hot travel bookings over the past two months and an emboldened attitude among prospective travelers may mean the long cold covid winter is finally over. recent news articles indicate available lodging and rental cars in popular destinations are already booked for the season. it s no wonder cdc data shows nearly 50 of the population has received one vaccination shot or more. according to a survey conducted by destination analysts as of memorial day 2021 the number of americans concerned about contracting the coronavirus the pandemic s impact on personal finances as well as the national economy hit historic lows. the average perception of travel and leisure activities as unsafe was cut in half compared to the beginning of the year and business travel is on the rise again too. it is encouraging to see travelers leave behind some of their pandemic fears and venture out once again. even so before they take off on their next business trip they should stay vigilant and remember that many hotels venues buildings and attractions have been closed or operating at less than half capacity for some time. in many cases shutting down included their hvac systems. just flipping the switch from off to on does not solve the problem. the increased humidity and stale air inside facilities whose hvac systems have lain dormant for weeks or even months could create a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. such conditions could result in serious health concerns for guests. hopefully the hotel in question has had a full hvac system evaluation and a comprehensive hvac environmental cleaning before inviting guests to return. based on our experience with hundreds of hotels across the united states and according to microbiologists and building scientists on our staff there are a few signs travelers should watch out for as they assess the quality of their lodging. if a traveler sees one of the following five signs it may indicate that management is not taking guests safety into account in relation to mold bacteria or covid 19 itself. if service records for environmental testing and cleaning are not prominently posted then management is not taking operations during current pandemic conditions seriously. whether it s the virus mold or some other issue now is no time to become complacent with indoor air quality for guests. 2. lack of new air cleaning monitoring technology . 3. dusty floors and walls . such conditions should sound the alarm for poor indoor air quality and indicate the hvac system may have maintenance issues. if the topical cleaning plan is outdated or not posted in your hotel room it is very likely your hotel has become a petri dish for pathogens. smells can be a major warning indicator of bacterial or mold growth in the building or hvac system. travelers should consider following their noses to a safer room. in addition to being vigilant about these warning signs travelers also should remember the importance of wearing masks in crowded spaces. in conclusion there is no one silver bullet that hotel and venue managers can use to ensure that covid 19 and other pathogens are prevented from recirculating through their hvac systems. like security indoor air quality is improved in layers and combined approaches. as travelers enter lodging they should keep an eye out for the five warning signs mentioned. if travelers are still in the booking process they should never hesitate to pick up the phone and ask management about the last time the hvac was serviced and environmentally cleaned. ask what extra steps the resort has taken to ensure its facilities indoor air quality is optimized. travelers will breathe easier both figuratively and literally knowing their hotel or venue management is doing all it can to keep them healthy and safe.

health,"prior to the creation of sahpra all new health technologies had to be approved by the medicines control council a process that could take years. the research released by percept this week shows the real potential of technology in the effective delivery of primary healthcare services across south africa. the research should thus be used as a road map to better healthcare services for all. we looked at practical examples from across africa and investigated how other countries used technology in their specific environments. our work shows that a lot can be achieved despite existing problems such as poor technological literacy poor uptake of smartphone capabilities and poor power supply. we will be sharing our findings with key stakeholders in the health sector and hope that it will be valuable for their work improving healthcare service delivery for all. while covid 19 linked recessions have highlighted the need for healthcare models that deliver primary healthcare in more cost effective ways the lockdowns have also created vast opportunities for the rapid growth and evolution of tech enabled healthcare delivery models. in time technological solutions will increasingly ensure that healthcare systems run more efficiently and effectively. it is their focus on specific points of the patient journey or specific parts of the system that their ability to ensure overall continuity of care and continued engagement with the primary healthcare system will require ongoing attention. innovations such as the ones highlighted in our research could provide solutions across multiple settings while a more connected health space would offer tangible economic benefits. to unlock these benefits it is however necessary to address tech related challenges and also relook at restrictive legislation and policies as this will ease the implementation of virtual health services. our research looked at a range of innovations that were rolled out in countries like rwanda uganda kenya and mozambique. the investigation focused on each application s value proposition uptake and potential scalability as well as the factors that promoted or undercut its success. enabling factors that consistently contribute to innovations fulfilling the goal to expand access to primary healthcare included partnering with governments sustainable sources of funding consumer trust and keeping tools simple while adapting them to meet specific technological and logistical challenges. at the same time there are constraints prevalent throughout the region which require tech enabled innovations to fine tune their offering to accommodate local contexts. this includes limited network coverage limited or costly mobile data poor connectivity limited access to electricity smartphone illiteracy low levels of literacy and education a diverse range of languages and limited funding. the success of tech enabled innovations in the region largely depends on sustainability and scalability building trust and transparency and keeping the applications simple and seamless and in particular enabling integration with public health sector systems.

weather,"climate disclosures have been increasingly scrutinised by investors and regulators globally and top lawyers say company directors could be liable for failing to understand and disclose climate risks could be sued for failing to act on those risks once known and may be liable for misleading or deceptive conduct for selectively disclosing exposures to climate change or declaring green goals while lacking credible plans to achieve them. the arguments have gained the backing of the reserve bank of australia asic the australian prudential regulation authority the asx corporate governance committee and the australian accounting standards board. the taskforce on climate related financial disclosures tcfd is now seen as the global standard for informing shareholders of the climate related risks faced by companies. however the cdp igcc and the pri argue more is needed to be done particularly to align reporting of climate related disclosures across major jurisdictions amid signs of support from the major g7 economies to consider making disclosures mandatory. the report confusion to clarity plan for mandatory tcfd in australia finds that although the number of asx200 companies that have adopted the tcfd framework has increased from 11 in 2017 to 60 in 2019 only 37 per cent of the top 200 companies have set emissions targets and most are only for the short term. moreover in the analysis where companies assess how they would fare under different environmental outcomes 32 companies use 35 different scenarios making it hard to compare and contrast. the report also found companies made limited attempts to be transparent on the assumptions and inputs that led to their scenario modelling while there was a low uptake of scenario modelling based on a warmer world which suggests companies were ignoring a tougher stress test on their portfolios. the issue also extended to companies most vulnerable to the transition away from fossil fuels and energy intensive sectors with many companies in the markets opting to hide assumptions underpinning climate analysis. the assumptions have real world implications with the assets company strategic direction and intangible goods all vulnerable to sharp changes in value due to physical risks presented by climate change or the realities of changing government policy and technologies. questionable assumptions and inputs may be causing overly optimistic views of future cash flows under a 2c or below scenarios the report said. few companies provide meaningful disclosure on physical risk. last year asic warned five companies and their auditors they risked breaking the law because of non disclosure of climate change risks. strike energy and its auditor deloitte the 400 million carnarvon petroleum and ey africa focused pancontinental oil gas perth based whitebark energy and kpmg and the 200 million leigh creek energy and auditor grant thornton all received warnings from the regulator as it ramps up its regulation of climate related disclosures for shareholders. the investor groups behind the report recommend asic review its guidance to ensure companies use the tcfd framework and enforce top firms adherence while apra should update its prudential guidance to ensure regulated entities adhere to the tcfd. meanwhile treasury should look to find the most efficient way to implement disclosure requirements and the asx should introduce on an if not why not basis mandatory disclosure for asx300 firms by next year and all other companies by 2023. cdp chief paul simpson said australia should be developing its own mandatory regime as a matter of priority to ensure the ongoing stability of the financial system and to remain competitive with global counterparts. igcc policy director erwin jackson said the phased implementation of climate disclosures was an opportunity to reduce red tape for businesses and to support investment. australian and global institutional investors are seeking to make multi billion dollar investments in the transition to net zero emissions today mr erwin said. pri chief fiona reynolds said the voluntary disclosure system was reaching the limits of what it could deliver. establishing a mandatory regime would provide much needed clarity for companies and financial organisations she said. australian council of superannuation investors boss louise davidson welcomed the plan. investors need detailed disclosure of climate related risks to adequately understand their exposure ms davidson said. s p global sustainable1 head of asia pacific esg business development michael salvatico said the market is indicating strong support for disclosures. the demand continues to rise for comparable and consistent scenario analysis to enable companies to unlock capital he said.

politics,"foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi on tuesday expressed concern over the rising trend of islamophobic attacks in the western world and called on the global community to pay attention and arrest the trend immediately . he made the comments while speaking about the killing of four members of a pakistan origin family in canada late on sunday evening in what the canadian police termed as a premeditated attack. a 20 year old suspect had rammed a pickup truck into the family of five who were reportedly out on their daily walk killing four of them and injuring the fifth a nine year old boy. there is evidence that this was a planned premeditated act motivated by hate. it is believed that these victims were targeted because they were muslim detective superintendent paul waight told a news conference. the names of the victims were not released but they include a 74 year old woman a 46 year old man a 44 year old woman and a 15 year old girl together representing three generations of the same family according to the city s mayor ed holder. speaking on the floor of the national assembly on tuesday qureshi said he had contacted pakistan s consul general in ontario as well as the country s high commissioner in canada for information adding that details of the attack made his heart shake and eyes wet . we are seeing the trend of islamophobic attacks for some time and they are on the rise in the western world. for the last two years we are bringing global attention to this that this is a trend not individual acts. he said western governments may want to colour it as the act of a crazed man or an individual act but if we see the trajectory this is a rising trend and it is concerning . qureshi said he was concerned the rising trend had started to divide societies . the foreign minister said around 65 million muslims resided in europe two million in canada and six million or more in the united states because of which the western world will have to pay attention to this. this rising trend of islamophobia will have to be arrested immediately. if western countries do not do this the situation can worsen society can be divided hate speech incitement conflict can be created. emotions arise and tragedies happen he warned. he said prime minister imran khan had also talked about islamophobia in the past stressing that the muslim ummah should be united and decide on a plan of action . if only pakistan raises its voice it will not be that effective. if we all raise our voices that will be effective qureshi emphasised adding that he had submitted a resolution on the instructions of pm imran during the 47th session of the oic council of foreign ministers in niamey asking the body to take up the problem with one voice . the resolution was not only adopted unanimously but muslim countries also directed their permanent representatives to the united nations in new york to take up the matter and build the international community s consensus on the issue he shared. pakistan s ambassador to the un munir akram was also playing his role he added. qureshi said that according to his conversation with pakistan s consul general in ontario there was a 12 hour gap between the incident and when the family was informed. our consul general was the first person to talk to the family and listen to them he disclosed. i believe that this is not only a hate crime and there is no doubt that four counts of murder are applicable to the suspect but we cannot rule out terrorism he said. giving details about the family he said they hailed from lahore and had moved to canada 10 years ago. the father was a physiotherapist and the family had spent ordinary lives living in peace and nobody had any complaints with them he added. only faith related hate can be seen in the incident that happened to them. the family s only sin was that they were from a society and a religion that repeats the kalima . qureshi said the family was shocked and grieving and was hesitant to talk to the media right now however the deceased man s brother who lived in australia had been contacted and he was flying to canada. he said that canadian prime minister justin trudeau had tweeted about the incident and adopted a clear stance which is encouraging . in his tweet trudeau had said he was horrified by the attack. to the loved ones of those who were terrorised by yesterday s act of hatred we are here for you he said singling out the nine year old boy in hospital. to the muslim community in london and to muslims across the country know that we stand with you. islamophobia has no place in any of our communities. this hate is insidious and despicable and it must stop he added. talking about trudeau s tweet qureshi said it was the same stance that had been taken by pakistan and the oic. he said he had shared the pakistani nation s emotions and concerns with canadian high commissioner to pakistan wendy gilmour. the foreign minister recalled new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern s response to the 2019 shootings at two mosques in christchurch and said the canadian premier who was very enlightened and progressive should also step up and rise to the occasion . qureshi suggested trudeau should meet the family of those killed saying it would reassure them. he also requested the pakistani community in canada to play their role and express solidarity with the family and console them . he also shared that the federal government had offered help to the family to bring back the bodies to pakistan but they said they do not want it . we are in contact with the canadian government and we are taking our policy on islamophobia forward he added. qureshi said international human rights organisations should discuss the attack because this is a human rights incident . he called upon the international media to not ignore this incident either so the global community could adopt a plan of action based on a holistic view against this trend .

social,world 31 more filipinos returning home from myanmar on june 27 . over 30 filipinos working in myanmar are set to be repatriated to the philippines on june 27 an envoy said wednesday. philippine ambassador to myanmar eduardo kapunan jr. said several filipinos have to go home due to the surge of covid 19 cases in myanmar. the envoy clarified that the repatriation was carried out not because of the ongoing unrest but mainly because of the covid 19 situation in the country. kapag nagra rally po ang mga tao wala na pong social distancing so we are expecting that it cases would rise when people go out to protest social distancing is not observed so we are expecting that it cases would rise katipunan said during the laging handa briefing on wednesday. now there seems to be a spike of covid 19 in myanmar. dahil dito nawawalan na sila ng trabaho. kung wala na silang trabaho the choice is to go home because of this they lose their jobs. if they have no jobs the choice is to go home he said. of the 1600 filipinos working in myanmar there are still about 600 left after a series of repatriation flights katipunan said. itong mga pilipinong ito wala kaming nakikitaan na may problema pa we don t see any problem with these filipinos . it means they don t see any much concern about the situation except the rising covid situation now going on in myanmar he said. the repatriated filipinos meanwhile are still not allowed to go back to myanmar. hangga t hindi bumababa sa alert level 2 hindi puwedeng bumalik ang mga pilipino sa myanmar because the threat of covid is still there while the alert level is not yet reduced to level 2 filipinos are not allowed to go back to myanmar because the threat of covid is still there he said. on february 24 the department of foreign affairs had raised alert level 2 in myanmar in view of the developing critical situation in the country and as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of several filipinos there. under alert level 2 only overseas filipino workers who have existing employment contracts will be allowed to travel to myanmar. 
weather,"paper on profession s future paints one dystopian scenario of ravages of ai with elite cadre of lawyers on performance enhancing drugs . the law society of england and wales has envisaged the future and found it to be potentially rather bleak with city lawyers being encouraged to take performance enhancing medication to remain competitive. predicting a future in which consumer services like property and private client law are delivered by large retail legal service providers it says commercial law firms will see large swathes of routine legal advice outsourced leaving an elite cadre of city and in house lawyers to advise in person. the cost pressures on the legal sector to adopt ai and streamline legal functions will lead to more work types being commoditised automated and self service in the near term the report finds. only the high value complex or newest areas of law will need human input. humans may also be needed in relationship management with larger clients it warns. those lawyers that remain in high end jobs the report says will be generally immune to a radical reduction in staff . the future worlds 2050 project was set up to enable raw frank and honest discussions around what clients will need in the future . its first report images of the future worlds facing the legal profession 2020 2030 pulls few punches. drawing on a delphi panel of futurologists and previously published research by kpmg the report sketches competing visions of the future one cautious the other more apocalyptic. cautious assessments of workforce change suggest a 20 decline by 2050 while the more catastrophic modelling envisages savage job cuts leading to a 50 reduction in the legal workforce. law society president stephanie boyce said the legal profession is at a pivotal moment as is the world in which we live. there are a plethora of forces shifting our collective experience and the business environment. if we ve learnt anything from 2020 it s that the future can still catch you unawares. the report forecasts extensive change to law firm partnerships by 2030 with extensive deskilling of the legal profession as ai takes over and dramatic changes in compensation as a result meaning that by 2030 everyone has a free lawyer at their disposal similar to siri . it adds that in one dystopian scenario lawyers remaining within the profession must work alongside technology and are required to take performance enhancing medication in order to optimise their own productivity and . other likely challenges include china s dominance as an economic and political superpower aspects of which can already be seen in recent events in hong kong as well as issues arising from green energy and climate change. boyce said new forms of green energy and climate change action could create opportunities for lawyers and their insurer clients as they seek to find innovative solutions to the risks posed by extreme weather events. legal input and advice will also be needed around green funding investors financing environmentally friendly companies and there is likely to be a rise in climate litigation against corporations or governments. in a more optimistic passage the report suggests technology could be leveraged in creative and socially advantageous ways to democratise access to justice in the legal sphere tackle environmental degradation and revolutionise health outcomes . boyce concluded this project is a unique opportunity to look ahead at the challenges and opportunities that may face us in the next decade. science fiction is already becoming a reality so what can we look forward to in 10 years time we intend to illuminate the path ahead for the profession so the future may be a little less uncertain.""

education,"allegations of homophobia are being investigated at df malan high school in bellville after a group of learners who were celebrating pride month at the school claimed they were surrounded threatened and intimidated . a pupil who would like to remain anonymous said that on monday they planned a gathering with all the learners of the lgbqti community and those in support of the community during their breaktime. we decided we should all gather eat our lunches together and just introduce ourselves to form better strength because sometimes we have quite a homophobic atmosphere. most of the breaktime we were just sitting and a few boys showed up and they intimidated one girl by saying she took photos of them and she should delete it but we haven t confirmed that she did even take those photos. it was obvious they were trying to intimidate us. their presence made more children gather and look at us and they started screaming slurs at us the learner said. wced spokesperson bronagh hammond said they noted the allegations with concern. the wced has been made aware of the allegations of homophobia at df malan high school. we note them with concern and have notified the district office who will be conducting an investigation into what has transpired. the school is currently identifying the learners that were involved in the incident. in terms of the constitution of the republic of sa the wced respects the rights of all including that of the lgbtqi community she said. a petition calling on the school to issue a public apology to the affected learners has since been launched. it claims that the school s principal prohibited further meetings of the lgbtqi community in the school. two matric learners went to the deputy principal to report the situation and he was apparently very understanding and said that it was unacceptable. the principal proceeded to speak to the learners about the situation. the principal mr sias conradie told them that they had been intimidated because they made themselves targets and that celebrating pride month is not inclusive. they were told that any more meetings of lgbtqi students are prohibited the petition read. according to a statement issued by the school governing body sgb the principal in consultation with members of the sgb decided not to grant the request for the celebration as it could lead to tension and division within the school. this observation was based on the tension that learners are already experiencing in terms of the pandemic and experienced academic pressure the sgb said. the principal suggested to the learner that there may be other events such as celebrating youth month which is more inclusive. however some learners decided to do a sit in during breaks. as the school anticipated this led to a group of learners to make unacceptable remarks. these unacceptable remarks were tossed back and forth. the outcome was exactly what the school wanted to prevent. the school regrets the incident. the school will investigate learners who violated the school s code of conduct. eduhelp the school s psychological support office is already busy supporting learners who have been traumatised by the incident the sgb said.

religion,"the court therefore directed strict adherence to government guidelines while handling and cremating dead bodies of those who have succumbed to coronavirus. larger national interest will prevail over personal rights traditions and customs during unprecedented times like covid 19 pandemic the jammu kashmir high court recently observed while directing strict adherence to government guidelines while handling and cremating dead bodies of those who have succumbed to coronavirus court on its own motion v s union territory of jammu and kashmir and others . a division bench comprising chief justice pankaj mithal and justice vinod chatterji koul while refusing to pass directions to hand over dead bodies of covid 19 victims to their next of kin said that the larger public interest always prevails over personal rights and the traditions and customs have to yield to the national interest especially in these unprecedented times . the court however expressed hope that authorities will not cause any harassment to the next of kin of any person dying due to covid 19 in viewing the face of the deceased and in allowing them to perform the last rites in the manner laid down as per the guidelines. the court was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation pil case related to covid 19 in which several miscellaneous applications were filed one of which was to hand over the dead body of a covid victim to the next of kin of the deceased. the plea filed by balvinder singh through advocate dinesh singh chauhan sought direction that since no post mortem or autopsy is necessary on account of death due to covid 19 the body should be handed over to the next of kin. the application also prayed that the face of the deceased be allowed to be seen by the relatives and they be permitted to perform rituals such as sprinkling of holy water etc before cremation. the ministry of health and family welfare has framed the guidelines in consultation with the experts dealing with covid 19 pandemic and as such if the guidelines do not permit handing over of the dead body specifically to the next of the kins and simply allow them to participate in the cremation burial and to perform the last rites that is more than sufficient otherwise it would be difficult to contain the spread of the disease the court said. the division bench also refused a prayer for conversion of a government stadium into vaccination centers on a pil filed by snehal arora through advocate aditya gupta. we do not think that such prayer requires to be considered by the court as it is for the administration to consider if they are short of place for vaccination centers the court said. however the bench also hoped that the government would prepare itself in advance to face the third wave if any and for that purpose care should be taken to vaccinate each and every citizen at the earliest by carrying out fresh drive institution wise so that if anyone has remained unvaccinated he she is also covered. the court also added that the government may ensure establishment of oxygen generation plants in every government and other hospitals or at any other place it considers appropriate adding that the temporary arrangements so far made may not be completely dismantled and may be kept in readiness for future.

across technological economic and social factors including paradigms goals and values became apparent during the covid 19 pandemic. according to the ipbes global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services there are plausible pathways for achieving the 2050 vision for biodiversity and other global goals but these necessitate fundamental changes in development paradigms and social ecological dynamics. these pathways require changes in society more sustainable use of land water energy and materials as well as changes in consumption habits food systems and global value chains.

factors corresponding to the indirect drivers of change in biodiversity that can be leveraged to achieve transformative change. it will then address their impact on the most important direct drivers of change. in its analysis of societal values and behaviors which underpin and co evolve with indirect drivers of change the assessment will take into account ways in which values influence behavior and how this differs regionally and between levels of development. it will also take into consideration notions of good quality of life worldviews and cultures models of interaction between nature and people and social narratives. other factors to be considered include equity and the need for just transitions. obstacles to achieving transformative change and lessons learned from previous

labour,"image credit supplied . if one thing has become increasingly apparent as a result of the pandemic it is the importance of community. in the traditional sense community is defined as a group of people linked by geographical location. however as a result of globalisation the term is synonymous with shared perspectives and common interests with geography becoming obsolete as a prerequisite for the formation of a strong community. the pandemic has highlighted that as a global community our futures are tightly intertwined and our own personal and professional successes are dependent upon those of our colleagues neighbours friends and family in short our tribe. in this sense community does not need to be simply defined as a group of people with whom we share interests but rather those upon which we rely on for mutual support. after all when others thrive so do we. trust is an essential component for any strong community and this was central to our approach to reimagining remittances. there are communities that do not have access to conventional banking and this needs to change. democratising the banking sector should be a key priority in a post covid 19 world. as a global society we must not ignore the more than one billion people worldwide who do not have a bank account. rather we must empower them to become the bank their community needs and have access to tech solutions that will enable them to financially support their tribe. low income expatriate workers have been especially vulnerable to effects of the pandemic. the traditional way in which many transferred their wages home proved to be wildly ineffective as exchange bureaus were forced to close. this had a huge impact upon workers ability to send money to families at a time when they needed it most. additionally many of the home countries of low income expatriate workers in the uae including india have been especially hard hit by the pandemic. by giving individuals the means in which to take full control of their finances including how they choose to support their families we can evolve global banking in a way that caters to the masses as opposed to just the privileged. fintech solutions aimed at democratising the banking system must take into account a crucial component namely trust and transparency. traditional banks do not do enough to provide financial control to hard working individuals many of whom send up to 80 per cent of their wages thousands of miles away. by enabling expatriate workers to share access to their credit or debit cards with those that they trust they can provide vital funds to their community of choice safely securely and instantly. this means that community members no longer need to rely upon banks to grant them loans but rather can depend upon the trust earned amongst their peers to access credit. and trust has the potential to be a gamechanger. enabling communities to make their own decisions about how they financially support one another based on their vast inter personal experiences can form a key pillar in post covid 19 economic recovery. there is no reason why credit should be confined within the borders of one nation when it can be effectively utilised and repaid by trusted family and community members around the globe. we are passionate about creating technology that allows just this that empowers individuals to decide how their wages and credit is utilised based on trust.

sport,"goals from raheem sterling and harry kane in the final 15 minutes finally gave the three lions a night to enjoy against the old enemy. england s john stones got the better of thomas muller and germany s frontline nick potts pa . the history of england versus germany weighs heavy on the nation given the heartache of the past with gut wrenching defeats at italia 90 euro 96 and the 2010 world cup. but the key message before this game was that this current crop of england players wanted to write their own history and they certainly did that at wembley. two goals in the final 15 minutes from raheem sterling and harry kane ensured that the three lions beat their old rival for the first time in a knockout tournament since 1966. football might be coming home. harry kane shrugged off criticism to score england s second nick potts pa . never has a player s perception turned around as quickly as harry kane s in recent weeks. after winning the premier league golden boot and playmaker awards he was lauded as one of the best strikers in the world but after going through the group stage without scoring people were beginning to question his place in the team. another frustrating match looked on the cards as the tottenham man squandered a golden chance just before the break but his moment came four minutes from time when he headed home jack grealish s cross from close range to bag his first goal at the european championship. kane said last week that he was beginning to peak and this certainly bodes well. england manager gareth southgate was redeemed by the victory mike egerton pa . no one has been reminded of england s previous failures against germany more than boss gareth southgate who missed that famous penalty 25 years ago in euro 96. what a moment of redemption for him at the place of his lowest moment. and after seeing his side deliver another clean sheet he will say he got his team selection and tactics spot on as england delivered one of their biggest ever performances in knockout football. of course nothing is won yet and a quarter final in rome against ukraine or sweden awaits but southgate will surely enjoy this as a career highlight. joachim low s long tenure as germany boss is over mike egerton pa . germany s defeat means that joachim low s 15 year stint as manager comes to an end. it has been quite a journey from the glory of winning the 2014 world cup in brazil to the ignominy of a group stage exit four years later. this current side are in transition and better days may be around the corner. but low will not be around to see it as his exit was confirmed before the tournament began. he would not have wanted to go out in this way with a defeat at wembley. a half full wembley roared england on to victory nick potts pa . there was only around 40000 in attendance but it felt like so many more were packed into wembley as there was a brilliant and partisan atmosphere. this was not only a celebration of football but also one of a return to some sort of normality as fans were allowed back into a stadium on a mass scale. indeed this was the biggest attendance at a football match in this country since march 2020 as the restrictions post lockdown continue to ease. and those england fans who were lucky enough to get a ticket might well say that all the hardship of the last 15 months was worth it.

weather,"there s nothing more enticing than an apparently easy solution to a complex in point electric vehicles. evs have been getting a high profile boost lately over and above the usual hype as politicians from president biden down to state and local officials have been pushing them as a primary way to reduce carbon emissions from transportation the largest contributor to climate change both nationally and statewide. now it is certainly true that if you re going to drive a motor vehicle in most cases it is environmentally better to go a mile in an ev than in a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle even with today s typical electric generation mix. but despite lacking a tailpipe evs are far from an environmental panacea. there are several reasons beyond the simple inefficiency of using a 4000 pound machine to move a 200 pound person. 1. by driving up electricity demand evs make it harder to shut down coal and gas powered generation plants. we re in a race to build enough renewable generation to replace carbon emitting generation and plugging in more power hungry evs moves the finish line farther out. it also means that when we do eventually replace all fossil fueled generation we ll have more miles of high voltage transmission lines and hundreds of thousands more acres covered with solar panels and wind turbines than we would need to power a more efficient transportation system. 2. production of evs is extremely resource intensive. beyond the usual steel and plastic and synthetic rubber needed for any car evs require large amounts of lithium for batteries and rare earth elements for motors. the new york times recently highlighted the environmental hazards of lithium mining and rare earth production dominated by china has been environmentally devastating. 3. most importantly evs do nothing to change our typical sprawling land consuming development pattern that s enabled by private motor vehicles. in the northern front range alone we see hundreds of acres of prairie farmland or forest devoured every year by car enabled car dependent development. travel to the dwindling area between broomfield and erie or to the once tiny now sprawling burbs of frederick firestone and dacono to see the vast tracts eaten up by a combination of nimbyism which pushes development out of city centers where it would be more sustainable and a car centric transportation system which enables it to manifest instead as low density sprawl in the hinterlands. the solution of course is not to stick with petroleum powered cars. the ev evangelists are right about this. the solution rather is to step back and rebuild our transportation and land use system in a way that s far more sustainable centered around human powered modes and transit. switching from a gasoline car to an ev is not too much more of a shift than changing incandescent light bulbs to leds hence the appeal. changing the way our cities look and work and feel is a far bigger undertaking. to its credit the biden administration seems to be taking on this challenge if not to the degree necessary to really address climate change at least far more seriously than any previous administration. at the state level the democrats transportation bill sb 260 takes baby steps towards changing a century s worth of unsustainable car centric highway planning but still includes 734 million in subsidies for evs plus hundreds of millions of dollars for highway widening digging us further into a hole of unsustainability. meanwhile there seems to be little appetite for taking the lead at the state level in guiding us towards a more environmentally friendly land use pattern. and in boulder we have declared a climate emergency and set some ambitious goals for a more sustainable transportation system but we are not on target to even come close to meeting them. evs must be part of the solution but the core of our approach must be a fundamental rebuilding of our cities around less driving and fewer cars. it s a daunting challenge and a long term project to undo a century s worth of auto centric planning but it s the only way to create a truly sustainable transportation system.

social,co founder of black lives matter movement patrisse cullors attends the united state of women summit on may 5 2018 in los angeles calif. photo by valerie macon afp via getty images . there are lots of reasons why wokeism spread like wildfire once america lost its collective mind during the pandemic quarantine self induced recession and rioting of 2020. wokeism was never really about racism sexism or other isms. for some it illustrated a psychological pathology of projection transferring one s own prejudices onto others in order to alleviate or mask them. so should we laugh or cry that black lives matter s self described marxist co founder might be a corporate grifter according to a new york post report patrisse khan cullors has accumulated several upscale homes and one of her foundations failed to report significant donations to the irs. is it the case that the more khan cullors professes marxist ideology and damns toxic whiteness the more she feels comfortable living in a million home in southern california s ritzy topanga canyon area . sheldon whitehouse d an outspoken liberal icon. he s one of the senate s most woke members. yet whitehouse turns out to be a member of a de facto all white beach club of elites in newport rhode island. is whitehouse committed in the abstract to rooting out white privilege so he can concretely relax amid it with fellow bluebloods . barack and michelle obama occasionally venture out of their multimillion dollar washington mansion or their martha s vineyard estate to lecture the country on its systemic racism. does such sermonizing square the circle that the obamas have no desire to return to their chicago home a city where hundreds of african american males were murdered in 2020 most of them by other black men . joe biden frequently lectures america on its racism and he unleashed the bureaucracies of the federal government to root out mythical white supremacist conspiracies. does penance explain biden s fixation on systemic racism when he condemns anonymous white racists does his outrage mitigate his son hunter s reported use of an anti asian slur in a 2019 text message . the second catalyst of wokeism is the distraction it provides from scary problems that threaten american civilization. while the country consumes itself in demanding more than 12 representation of black actors in television commercials it is nearing 30 trillion in national debt. eventually the astounding red ink will require recessionary belt tightening more inflationary money printing or both. the woke biden administration can t stop hundreds of thousands of immigrants from illegally entering the united states this year. almost all are in need of free american health care housing food and legal subsidies. violent crime is spiking at an alarming rate. yet few dare say why that is or how to stop it. america can t seem to face the likelihood that chinese researchers engineered a gain of function virus with oversight from the chinese military and subsidies from the united states. so instead of offering real solutions to these crises we war with each other over whether the deceased children s book author dr. seuss or the plastic toy mr. potato head were racist or otherwise exclusionary. when our elites are clueless about national debt inflation illegal immigration crime soaring gas prices and a global pandemic they reassure themselves that at least they can cancel out father junipero serra or knock down another statue of robert e. lee. finally the hysterias of wokeism are being channelled for profit if they do not already reflect the reality of many of our most woke being the richest among us. one reason why oprah winfrey meghan markle and lebron james hype charges of white racism is to remind america that one can become rich as croesus yet remain a sympathetic victim. for next generation grifters such as ibram x. kendi and robin diangelo to claim that america was is and always will be racist means more than just speaking gigs and book sales. the solution for the pseudo crises they invent is the mass re education of self confessional whites with lucrative consulting fees for both and for thousands of others. america is systematically being conned by those who disguise their hypocrisy who manipulate the guilt ridden who have no interest in solving america s most dangerous problems and who get or stay rich by hyping an america in need of massive rebooting. 
environmental,"perovskite solar cells could be manufactured more efficiently and with less waste after scientists discovered a way of extending the shelf life of precursor solutions. tests carried out by the researchers from sheffield university s energy institute and department of physics and astronomy found that storing perovskite precursor solutions at low temperatures increases their durability extensively. uk project to advance organic and perovskite solar cells . swansea team on a roll with printed perovskite solar cells . according to the university this development could potentially make the manufacture of perovskite solar cells more efficient as the process would require fewer batches of more stable material to be produced saving time reducing material waste and also allowing device yield and efficiency to be optimised. perovskite solar cells are fabricated using simple solution based techniques similar to those used in the printing industry and companies looking to commercialise perovskite solar cells are thinking about the best ways to manufacture at high volume. in a statement professor david lidzey from sheffield university s department of physics and astronomy said if a company cannot produce large volumes of precursor solutions and be able to rely on them performing consistently it further complicates the manufacturing process. we have shown that this problem can be side stepped by storing such materials at low temperature. precursor solutions are used to create the perovskite light absorbing layer which is positioned between electrically conductive layers. the efficiency of a perovskite solar cell critically depends on the composition of the perovskite which is itself dependent on the chemistry of the precursor solution. understanding how these solutions change over time is of significant importance if we are to use them to make the highest performance solar cell devices said professor lidzy. in collaboration with university of sheffield spinout company ossila ltd the physics and astronomy researchers carried out a series of experiments to test the stability of perovskite precursors. to explore ways to try and enhance the shelf life of the perovskite precursor the sheffield researchers kept some of the precursor samples at room temperature and refrigerated others at 4oc for varying periods of time. these aged solutions were then used to make solar cell devices. other experiments looked at the structure and composition of the perovskite films created using aged solutions. lead phd researcher mary o kane said while searching for a simple method to increase precursor solution shelf life we also had to use a series of techniques to understand how the chemical composition of the solution changed with time. this allowed us to identify several key reactions that caused their degradation.

including satellite news stations news papers and wire services are chronicling the herd s more than year long 500 kilometer 300 mile trek from their home in a wildlife reserve in mountainous southwest yunnan province to the outskirts of the provincial capital of kunming. the 15 member herd has been caught at night trotting down urban streets by security cameras filmed constantly from the air by more than a dozen drones and followed by those seeking to minimize damage and keep both pachyderms and people out of harm s way. while no animals or people have been hurt reports put damage to crops at more than 1 million. sixteen animals were originally in the group but the government says two returned home and a baby was born during the walk. the herd is now composed of six female and three male adults three juveniles and three calves according to official reports. what exactly motivated them to make the epic journey remains a mystery although they appear to be especially attracted to corn tropical fruit and other crops that are tasty plentiful and easy to obtain in the lush tropical region that is home to about 300 of the animals. others have speculated their leader may be simply lost. asian elephants are loyal to their home ranges unless there have been disturbances loss of resources or development in which case they may move out according to nilanga jayasinghe manager for asian species conservation at the world wildlife fund. in this case we do n t really know why they left their home range but do know that there has been significant habitat loss due to agriculture and conversion of forests into plantations within that range in the last few decades jayasinghe wrote in an email. what possibly happened here is that in their search for new habitat they got lost along the way and kept going. authorities have been working to avoid negative interactions and must determine what the best next steps here are and keep human elephant conflict at bay jayasinghe wrote. kunming is to host the upcoming convention on biological diversity s convention of parties to discuss topics such as human wildlife conflict and this is a real time example of the importance of addressing the issue and its root causes for the benefit of both wildlife and people she wrote. elephants are given the top level of protection in china allowing their numbers to steadily increase even as their natural habitat shrinks and requiring farmers and others to exercise maximum restraint when encountering them. government orders have told people to stay inside and not to gawk at them or use firecrackers or otherwise attempt to scare them away. so far more passive means are being used to keep them out of urban areas including the parking of trucks and construction equipment to block roads and the use of food drops to lure them away. as of tuesday the herd remained on the outskirts of kunming a city of 7 million with one of the males having moved away on his own creating even more excitement and worry for those attempting to keep tabs on them. a statement monday from a provincial command center set up to monitor the group said the elephants appeared to be resting while more than 410 emergency response personnel and police personnel scores of vehicles and 14 drones were deployed to monitor them. area residents were evacuated temporary traffic control measures

health,"ontario s chief medical officer of health says some critics do n t understand the challenges. toronto on the eve of his retirement as ontario s top doctor david williams says the effort to control the covid 19 pandemic has gone better than he had expected. i think it s gone quite well dr. williams said in an interview tuesday with tbnewswatch. he retires on friday from the post of chief medical officer of health several months after his five year appointment in february 2016 was scheduled to expire. williams will be succeeded by dr. kieran moore currently the medical officer of health for the kingston area. his legacy of public service includes 18 years as medical officer of health for the thunder bay district health unit during two separate terms starting in 1991. during the pandemic some critics have faulted him for his communication style and for not pushing the government to impose stronger restrictions in advance of an upsurge in covid cases earlier this year. the head of the registered nurses association of ontario was particularly harsh charging that williams lacked foresight at the outset and appeared incapable of standing up to premier ford. as part of her critique of the provincial government s handling of the crisis last november auditor general bonnie lysyk also suggested williams had not led the response. williams defended the job he s done saying some people do n t understand the challenges the pandemic presented for ontario. when you try to compare ontario to any other province you ca n t do the comparison he said. he cited the province s sheer size and multicultural diversity as unique factors in dealing with a public health crisis having nearly 15 million people and a centre like the greater toronto area that normally has almost 200000 people coming in internationally every day. even during the pandemic we dropped down to 38000 people a day. other provinces dropped down to nearly nothing. williams noted that the infection and death rates in ontario were far lower than other jurisdictions such as in the which he credited largely to teamwork within the public health network and to the abundance of experts that no other province has. while acknowledging that people are hurting in many ways and not just from covid he said that for a lot of ontarians it s been disrupted but it has n t been a dismantling. they have been able to work around it. for some it s been almost like a nuisance rather than a crisis. we ve come out a lot better than i anticipated williams says . he pointed to the province s pandemic plan which projected that a minimum of 20 to 30 per cent of the population would test positive. that means instead of 570000 cases we should have by now million to million people positive and three per cent of those are going to die. we have n t had anywhere near those kinds of numbers. williams suggested that his handful of critics have tended to say the same things again and again sometimes getting personal which he described as unprofessional on their part. that s far outweighed by all the positive commentary i get. their commentary about the lack of communication .i am overwhelmed by the number of emails i get about how much they appreciate the clear concise and consistent communication that i ve undertaken over the last year and a half. it s totally opposite of what these critics would like to comment on. people are allowed to have a difference of opinion as long as they have something to back it up. i found that a lot of the assertions lacked detail and numbers but at the same time i listened to them. williams added that there may be six or seven people that do n t feel great about how he s handled the pandemic but there are 800 or 900 others whom he is consulting all the time and who have positive input. i do n t get too worried about that aspect. i think they have to assess their own performance and see what they did. because in a pandemic and crisis if you re not with the program then you re against the program. it s better to be at the table and contribute with suggestions. he maintained that his style of leadership has enabled him to win the strong respect of premier ford and his cabinet. most of the time my advice was widely taken seriously williams said. even when the premier said at times this is going to be tough decision one of the hardest ones to make but i understand where you re coming from and i ll go out and say it . he believes that when the pandemic is over ontario may reflect further on the risk of being so dependent on foreign suppliers for critical items. williams said what bothered him the most during the pandemic was those occasions when resources were not available particularly vaccine supplies but in a global reality some things are under your control some things are not under your control. he s pleased though with the current covid 19 vaccination rate of about 75 per cent to date particularly in comparison with historical flu vaccine rates which he said have never exceeded 47 per cent of the population. williams also said vaccines for children aged five to 12 may be available this fall. he expects that by late summer ontario will return to a new normal in which covid 19 will be in the background rather than the foreground albeit with the awareness that new strains of the virus may continue to pose a challenge. i think we re in a very good position. he said but the public is much more alert to the risks of infectious diseases. i think people will be less likely to congregate in large crowds for a period of time at least. williams plans to take some time off to enjoy his retirement with his children and grandchildren and work on improvements at his summer cottage. as he told his wife this is the first time in 40 years he wo n t be on call. ultimately williams hopes to return to nepal to visit a hospital he worked at for 10 years earlier in his career. but covid 19 wo n t let go of him quite yet as he needs to participate in some internal reviews of ontario s response to the pandemic starting in just a couple of weeks.

science,"the end of the covid 19 pandemic is still a long way away. however it is already a good time to reflect on how we have tried to maintain a vibrant research community. we have all been forced to adapt to the unusual circumstances of the past 15 months. researchers have managed to maintain productivity at least if the number of submissions that nature plants have received is anything to go by. this has been achieved in part by adopting creative ways to do remotely what was previously done in person. some of these ideas have proven so successful that they deserve to become permanent fixtures of the life scientific. others that were commonplace and thought essential before 2020 have been so easily replaced that they may never return. despite additional security and safety measures performing experimental work has not substantially changed. the culture of the laboratory will hopefully return as well. meetings held on programmes such as zoom or teams are functional but a poor substitute for an in person coffee and cake session. most researchers will be missing the regular gatherings that pull a laboratory together and make it more than the sum of its members. similarly there is an activation energy required for instant messaging that is not present when sharing an office with colleagues colleagues who may unexpectedly have the answer to the problem you are struggling over. lectures and seminars have also been moved online. in early 2020 this mostly entailed the speaker sharing their screen with attendees and delivering their standard script. however online talks have developed. they do not have to be live but can be pre recorded removing the problems of recalcitrant technology and unreliable internet connections. this allows lecturers to ensure that their presentations appear exactly as intended and fit within their allotted time slot . technically minded individuals can seamlessly integrate all sorts of media a live question session can still follow but written questions submitted through a chat window are easier to moderate. these are excellent developments that were already happening to some degree before covid 19 accelerated their adoption. another advantage is that these recordings can be made available for consumption at a later date increasing their reach to anyone interested at any time. it seems very likely that the pre recorded lecture will become much more common or even the norm. this is an obvious advantage to lecturers especially for undergraduate teaching. if a presentation can be recorded it can be reused. for research lectures this may not be particularly helpful as there is a desire to include the most up to date results even if 90 of the story has been told before. however undergraduate lectures do not change much from year to year. the same recording of introduction to plant genetics 101 can be rereleased each year this idea is seductive but has its downsides even basic lectures will become stale and out of date quite quickly and it is far from easy to ignite a student s interest without the personal experience of an expert s enthusiasm. of course lectures that have been recorded for one university can be easily used at other schools. there are already companies that sell recordings of great courses of lectures delivered over the internet. these seem to be primarily aimed at the amateur infotainment seeking user but this business model could be easily adapted. if so freed from the need for a balanced range of expertise available universities may start over specializing in particular subjects or even decide that they do not need as many experienced staff a threat to the continued health of less charismatic research areas including many aspects of plant biology. two members of the nature plants editorial team are based in china and are currently making the rest of us jealous by their ability to attend conferences and visit research institutes in person. for the rest of us meetings great and small have had to be virtual affairs. even when it is again possible to fill lecture halls with delegates the emergence of new variants of the sars cov 2 virus will make international travel less straightforward than pre pandemic. virtual conferences or at least conferences with a virtual component are here to stay. the time saved in not travelling to attend in person will be very welcome and we are all well aware that fewer journeys by plane will be a help in addressing climate change. but other important aspects will be lost. despite the internet s undoubted ability to connect people across continents it is not a good venue for serendipity. the chance encounters that take place during coffee breaks or lunches on shuttle buses or while hanging around the conference venue are very difficult to reproduce virtually. it is exactly these fortuitous meetings that can lead to the unexpected collaborations and research approaches that drive science forward. as editors we particularly value these less formal conversations. this is where researchers will talk freely about the experiments they have not yet completed. we can learn about alliances and collaborations that could affect the effectiveness of the peer review process and meet early career researchers often long before we see or publish their papers. as a consequence the most important part of a conference for an editor is probably the poster sessions. sadly the poster session experience has proven to be highly unsatisfactory when reproduced virtually. displaying a poster online is easy enough but in a remote environment these have to be actively sought by scanning through a list of titles and abstracts. perhaps there should be a random shuffle for virtual poster sessions but i haven t yet seen any conference employing one. it must also be a dispiriting experience for the poster presenter waiting in an empty chat room hoping that someone will join them. when they do it tends to be to ask very specific questions that fail to develop into a discussion. you can t even chat to the person with the poster next to you . scientific research has managed to weather this pandemic relatively well and some of the new ways of working have positive advantages that will continue far into the future. however the essence of our community forged through shared experiences is threatened if too many of our interactions continue to be online. or maybe i just can t wait to get back to the thrill of cruising down aisles of poster boards not knowing what fascinating and unexpected research and researcher will be just around the next corner. cite this article .

unrest,"national cup 73 bradford park avenue boss mark bower has blasted the fa s decision to reject the club s appeal against a fine of more than 7500 for failing to fulfil three fixtures last season. avenue were charged with three breaches of the national league rules for failing to fulfil fixtures against blyth spartans farsley celtic and hereford on february 6 9 and 13 in vanarama national league north. this was subject to any decision being made to end the season early fixtures after . february 6 would be effective. the national league north season was declared null and void on february 18 due to the pandemic. an independent panel found avenue to be in breach of its rules and imposed a sanction of 2000 per breach for a total fine of 6000. this is topped up by a further 1600 after the club was ordered to pay costs. avenue s squad is back in pre season training today as they gear up for the start of the new season on august 14. bower said the fine added insult to injury. i was really disappointed. at the time we were seeing the good from people coming together people making sacrifices ultimately to try to get ourselves back to normal. this decision seems completely contradictory to that. we were very honest about the position we were in as a club at that time. it will have a big impact on my squad through no fault of our own. the fine is a player out of my squad a first team starter . we have got to crack on and put it behind us get out there and play. in its summary the fa s independent appeal board which met on june 9 said the club avenue did not place its financial information before the panel to demonstrate financial reasons why it was unable to play the fixtures. it was not the obligation of the league or the panel to identify previous correspondence or information provided by the club and decide what should be deployed in support of the club s case. the panel imposed a fine of 2000 for each breach which was less than the lowest end of the guidelines. such a fine could not be described as excessive. avenue were one of 11 national league clubs to have their appeals rejected earlier this month. the other sides included darlington curzon ashton and bath city. meanwhile jack pearce has been appointed as the new chairman of the national league. bower also paid further tribute to avenue stalwart colin barker who died earlier this month. he said colin was a constant. what a hole he leaves at the club. it wo n t be the same without him here. we will really miss him. he was bradford park avenue to the core.

crime,"tried as an adult when she was just a fifth grade student piara akhter spent the last 24 years of her life in jail for a murder she says she did not commit. released from barishal central jail on june 10 for good behaviour piara hardly recognised anyone from her past life the world outside the walls of the prison is utterly unfamiliar to her. i have been imprisoned for 24 years because of a conspiracy. i have not committed any crime who will give me back those 24 years she asked while talking to the daily star on wednesday. i was in fifth grade when a policeman came to my primary school and took me into their custody. he said if i want to be free i have to say that i hit my cousin and she fell into a canal adjacent to our home at choto haji village under pirojpur s mathbaria upazila and so i said that in court. piara whose father anis mridha passed away before the incident told the daily star that her family had a dispute with her uncle ziaul haque over land. piara s elder brother yunus mridha was out of the picture as he was working as a mason in the capital then. when ziaul s seven or eight year old daughter died in 1997 he conspired so that piara said in court what the police official had taught her. she was then taken to pirojpur district jail. piara could not remember the name of the police official. local administration and this correspondent tried to reach ziaul but could not because he lives in a remote area. deputy inspector general of police barishal range sm akhtaruzzaman said we have heard of this incident. if there was any police role behind it no apology would be accepted. we are investigating this incident. pirojpur district jail superintendent shamim iqbal said piara had been convicted in a murder case. she was sentenced on september 29 1998 by a pirojur district and sessions judge and her age was shown in the case docket to be 18 years. she had since been in barishal central jail until her release earlier this month. over these years spent in the women s ward of the prison she said she has forgotten her family members none of whom contacted her while she was incarcerated. i could n t really identify my family members when i returned to my ancestral house with a member of the social services department after being released from jail. i do n t remember much about my childhood said piara. my uncle ziaul haque was hostile to us. his daughter died i do n t even remember how she died. i did not commit any crime but was imprisoned without any reason. the barishal deputy commissioner arranged my release. sajjad hossain probation officer of the social services department and one of those who worked to get piara released said she had been sentenced to life imprisonment when she was a child. he said due to her good behaviour they applied for release at 24 years and the home ministry reduced her sentence by six years paving the way for her release. barishal deputy commissioner md jasim uddin haider said i am shocked to hear about piara akhter s case. i think something went wrong somewhere. a child of class five is not supposed to be convicted in this court. i think her age then may have been eleven or twelve. we have decided not only to release her but also to give her a government house and a job. al mamun deputy jailer of barishal central jail said piara akhter s age was not shown in the jail case document adding that after she served for 24 years authorities applied for a mercy release due to her good behaviour. deputy commissioner jasimuddin haider said she is somewhat traumatised. it will take some time to settle down.

disaster,"illinois as summer draws near illinois and dozens of other states could benefit from a little less sunshine and a little more rain this week. for the week ending june 8 31 states were experiencing drought conditions described as moderate or worse according to data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. in northern illinois conditions are abnormally dry a moderate drought or a severe drought depending on where exactly you live. according to the national drought mitigation center temperatures were well above normal in our area and very little rain fell at all over the week. there was a slight expansion of abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions over northern illinois due to the weather. nationally nearly 39 percent of the united states was experiencing some type of drought for the week ending june 8 according to the latest noaa data. in addition to million people more than 78 million acres of crops are being affected by the dry conditions. last week rain brought respite to much of the great plains however as extreme heat moves into the dry west and northern plains noaa forecasters warn that drought may intensify. meanwhile in the southeast dryness and drought have been steadily spreading in virginia the carolinas and florida. the worst areas of drought are in southwest states where parts of california nevada arizona new mexico utah and colorado are experiencing extreme or exceptionally severe drought conditions according to the national drought mitigation center. drought is defined as a lack of precipitation such as rain snow or sleet over a period that typically results in a water shortage. while drought usually stems from an area s specific weather pattern it can also be triggered by human activity such as water use and management. behind hurricanes drought is the second most costly form of natural disaster in the united states exacting an average toll of billion in damage and loss per event according to statistics from the national centers for environmental information. usually some level of drought has some part of the country in its grip. during the historic dry spell of 2012 the nation s most extensive since the 1930s as much as two thirds of the country was affected by drought at its peak. droughts can sometimes last longer than a season. from 2012 to 2016 scant rainfall and record breaking heat in california created what is estimated to have been the state s worst drought in 1200 years according to the national resources defense council. fortunately for everyone water is a renewable resource that moves in a cycle with neither a beginning nor an end. typically the united states receives enough precipitation during an average year to cover the states in a depth of about 30 inches. but when it does rain what happens to water when it reaches the ground . about 70 percent of the annual precipitation returns to the atmosphere by evaporation from land and water surfaces and by vapor from vegetation. the remaining 30 percent eventually reaches a stream lake or ocean due to runoff during and immediately after rain as well as soaking into the ground. if you ve ever wondered where a raindrop ends up when it falls in illinois check out this interactive map developed by data analyst sam learner that traces the path of a raindrop depending on where it falls.

social,photo steveallenphoto istock getty images plus . on june 16 texas governor greg abbott signed legislation that would almost completely ban abortions in the state should the supreme court ever invalidate the 1973 roe v. wade decision which allows for abortion in the united states. house bill 1280 also known as the human life protection act will take effect if the supreme court wholly or partly overrules roe v. wade or if a constitutional amendment ever allows states to ban abortions. the law is what is known as a trigger bill and would go into effect 30 days after a ruling invalidating roe v. wade or constitutional amendment allowing abortion bans triggers the new law. exceptions are in place if there are risks to the mother s life or if there could be a substantial impairment of major bodily function. the new law would make it a second degree felony to attempt to perform an abortion. if the abortion is successful and the baby dies the penalty would rise to a first degree felony which could potentially lead to a life sentence. besides the possible jail time abortionists could lose any medical license they might have and be subject to fines of up to 100000. women who seek abortions are immune from prosecution under the terms of the law. since a constitutional amendment allowing states to ban abortion seems unlikely the most likely way for the bill to become law is if the supreme court invalidates all or part of roe v. in may the high court agreed to hear the case of dobbs v. jackson women s health organization. that case involves a mississippi law which forbids abortion after 15 weeks gestation. wade is at the heart of the case and all or parts of it could be overturned. many court watchers consider dobbs v. jackson women s health organization a direct challenge to roe v. a favorable ruling would make texas one of the first states to end abortions the bill s author state rep. giovanni capriglione r tarrant county said. pro life advocates were predictibly happy with the new law. we are extremely pleased at the passage of hb 1280 said dr. joe pojman executive director of texas alliance for life when the legislation was passed in may. to whatever extent the supreme court allows states to protect unborn babies from abortion whether at 15 weeks six weeks or at conception the human life protection act will go into effect to the same extent. the passage of the human life protection act is especially significant in light of the recent announcement of the united states supreme court to consider the dobbs v. jackson women s health organization case pojman said. pro abortion forces were typically outraged by abbott s signature on the bill. hb 1280 is different from and more extreme than most trigger bans and goes against the majority of texans support for safe legal abortion. the bill would allow a total abortion ban to go into effect in texas if the supreme court partly overruled roe or if the court partly gave the state the authority to prohibit abortion said dyana limon mercado the executive director of planned parenthood texas votes in a statement. limon mercado chastised the state legislature for focusing on abortion instead of other problems in the state saying members of the texas legislature prioritized abortion bans attacks on trans kids permitless carry and voter suppression bills. the people of texas deserve better. abbott and the texas legislature have been busy on the abortion front having signed the texas heartbeat act in may which effectively bans abortions in the state as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected which is often as early as four weeks into a pregnancy. that law is set to take effect at the beginning of september although the bill is expected to face multiple legal challenges prior to its implementation. in addition to the state of texas taking action on abortion several localities in the state including lubbock a city of 260000 residents have acted to curtail abortion within their city limits. lubbock has declared itself a sanctuary city for the unborn. with the federal government currently held hostage by far left ideologues this is how the fight against the killing of the unborn looks for the time being. yet there is a game changer stratagem that the pro life movement could start employing in a big way in its decades long fight to end the barbarism of abortion. that stratagem is for states to recognize that roe v. wade is an unconstitutional overreach on the part of the supreme court and to declare roe unconstitutional within their state borders on the basis of nullification. a report by the pro abortion guttmacher institue released in april shows the palpable angst among the pro abortion crowd. 2021 is on track to become the most devastating anti abortion state legislative session in decades said elizabeth nash and lauren cross of the guttmacher insititute.

health,"cambridge mass. paragonix technologies inc. today announces the launch of its clinical global registry guardian lung global utilization and registry database for improved preservation of donor lungs . the guardian lung study is unlike any lung donation registry as it seeks to evaluate a missing piece of the organ donation process the impact of methods and technologies used for lung preservation and transportation on the success of transplant surgery. the clinical study is registered at and is open to all lung transplant centers that are looking to analyze patient outcomes based on donor lung preservation methods. clinical investigators from the enrolling centers will pool their data and analyze the differences in clinical outcomes of patients who receive donor lungs preserved either in the paragonix lungguard donor lung preservation system or with traditional methods of storing in a consumer cooler on ice. the study will focus on short term post transplant outcomes within the first 48 hours intermediate term outcomes within the first 30 days and long term outcomes 1 year survival . all programs should be seeking the opportunity to participate and contribute to this study. paragonix has previously found that preservation method does positively impact a patient s stay in the icu1. the guardian lung study follows the success of paragonix s first registry guardian for evaluating donor heart preservation comparing historic ice storage to the paragonix sherpapak cardiac transport system. in a recently presented multi center clinical study investigators found that the donor hearts preserved by the paragonix sherpapak system had statistically significant increases in total ischemic time and travel distance meaning the organ was able to be effectively preserved outside a human body longer and be retrieved from donors at a greater distance from the recipient. an analysis of the patients with extended ischemic times found the portion of patients in the icu for two weeks or more was reduced by 50 percent in the paragonix sherpapak cohort and the portion of patients in the icu for only a week or less was increased by more than double with the paragonix system compared to ice . transplant surgery presents many unknowns and complexities. we ve invested in these studies to better support the transplant teams and patients by providing insights that may help them in handling the dynamics of the entire operation from transport to transplant said lisa anderson ceo of paragonix technologies. the first results of our guardian registry for heart preservation and transplantation sets an exciting and optimistic stage for what we can achieve for further supporting lung preservation and transplantation. the importance of both the heart and lung registries is clear to transplant teams around the world the more data we have on the variables of the entire transplant process the more lives we can potentially save said errol bush md surgical director advanced lung disease and lung transplant program and associate professor of surgery at johns hopkins medicine. insights gathered from the initial heart registry not only inform new approaches to organ preservation but show that preservation could be crucial in overcoming other considerations of the transplant procedure that may be challenging such as donor and recipient characteristics. the lungguard system provides a highly controlled environment for hypothermic lung preservation coupled with real time digital monitoring to safeguard donor lungs throughout the entire transport journey via the paragonix app where historically communication and coordination has been difficult. paragonix s centralized communication and data transfer capabilities are fully compatible with and integrated into the usage of the lungguard system. this system is based on the same architecture as the award winning paragonix sherpapak system that has successfully transported over 800 donor hearts since clinical launch in 2018. the guardian studies are the only and largest registries focused on donor organ preservation. paragonix is committed to understanding the science of organ preservation investing in the research to understand the impact of devices such as its sherpapak cardiac transport system and lungguard donor lung procurement system. about paragonix technologies . paragonix technologies markets organ transportation devices that safeguard organs during the journey between donor and recipient patients. our devices incorporate clinically proven and medically trusted cold preservation techniques in a novel suspension system to provide unprecedented physical and thermal protection. paragonix sherpapak cts is the only commercially available fda cleared and ce marked transport device for heart transportation. connect with us on linkedin paragonix technologies . d alessandro et al. the journal of heart and lung transplantation 2021 volume 40 issue 4 supplement s127 april 01 2021 .

outbreaks. ap overnight summer camps will be allowed in all 50 states this season but covid 19 rules and a pandemic labor crunch mean that many fewer young campers will attend and those who do will have to observe coronavirus precautions for the second consecutive year. the southeast is the first region to kick off camps this month with other parts of the country to follow in july. camp might look a little different but camp is going to look a lot better in 2021 than it did in 2020 when it didn t happen said matt norman of atlanta who is getting ready to send his 12 year old daughter to camp. even though most camps will be open reduced capacity necessitated by covid 19 restrictions and the labor shortage will keep numbers well below a normal threshold of about 26 million summer campers said tom rosenberg of the american camp association. across the country many camps face competition for counselors in a tight job market. traditional recruitment tactics like job fairs on college campuses have been canceled. it s been hard to get people to work said josh nelson at glorieta adventure camp a facility in pine covered foothills outside santa fe new mexico. a group of glorieta camp staffers started their orientation by rolling up their sleeves and getting vaccinated in an area between the mess hall and the water slides. but many campers are too young to get the shots because the vaccines have not been approved for children under 12. that means this year s camp experience will still involve many of the same prevention practices that were adopted at the small number of camps that operated last year. those measures include grouping kids in cohorts mandating masks emphasizing social distancing and lots of hand washing. some states like vermont are offering free virus testing for campers. at an all girls camp called fernwood in maine about 200 of the 300 counselors and campers will be vaccinated by the time the six week term starts. going into it it s a much better scenario for us. because instead of being worried about 300 people we re worried about 100 people fernwood director fritz seving said. norman plans to send daughter jane ellen to camp illahee in brevard north carolina and he s glad the camp is encouraging vaccinations. jane ellen agreed and said the focus on vaccines is a good idea. back at glorieta staff arrived in may from oklahoma texas and a college town in mexico called puebla where an in person recruiting fair took place. they have been training on safety protocols including virus protection zip lining and life guarding. the camp is running at one third capacity 1100 out of 3000 slots are filled and staff will be grouped in pods. kids are expected to wear masks even outdoors except when the are eating meals or in their sleeping dorm. more than 90 of the staff agreed to be vaccinated but there was no mandate for vaccinations. even with those limitations the outlook is much better than last year when camp was canceled and 80 of the staff was laid off by march nelson said. federal paycheck protection program loans helped but didn t alleviate all of the financial pain he said. rosenberg said camp is more important than ever in terms of providing normalcy for kids who have dealt with remote learning canceled events and boredom at home not to mention health worries. camp will let them practice engaging peer to peer and offer a chance to to try new activities take positive risks and be out in nature and sort of regain some of the humanity they ve lost over the past year. last year about million kids missed out on camp but most of the overnight camps that opened operated successfully. more than 250 people were infected at a camp in georgia and more than 80 infected at a camp in missouri.

contestants coupled up and played some bizarre drinking games they settled in and were lulled into a false sense of security on their first night in the villa. until of course the first twist was revealed that a new girl would be entering the villa meaning that there would be an odd number of girls meaning one will be dumped from the island. look if you are a love island fan you know the drill. we all walk the same path. except this time the twist was a bit meta in that usually the presenter announces it not the contestant but laura whitmore was nowhere to be seen. so it fell to chloe who was clearly forced by producers to let the other islanders know she had hopped off the plane via a voice note sent to their phones designed to stir up maximum aggro. but while the female contestants were rattled by the prospect of losing their partner early doors and the male contestants were excited people at home found it a little embarrassing . me when chloe was trying to sound

education,"minneapolis ap a new student group in the university of minnesota school of dentistry is looking to continue the effort to advance diversity equity and inclusion in the school. the group better together hosted its first event on may 25 exactly one year after george floyd was murdered in minneapolis. arpun johal a third year student in the school and one of the group s founding members said floyd s murder prompted the group s formation. last year i feel that many people did a lot of reflection about racism and the political climate in the johal said. from that we noticed that there was a lot of work to be done in our own careers to help with the larger civil rights movement. the group s first meeting covered recent hate crimes against asian americans and pacific islanders anti asian racism the experiences of asian dental students at the university and how to become a better ally to asian students and patients the minnesota daily reported. since may 2020 hate crimes against asians in 16 of the country s largest cities and counties are up 164 according to the center for the study of hate and extremism at cal state university san bernardino. new york city saw the largest increase in such reported crimes against asians with a 223 spike in early 2021. johal said it was important to cover this topic at the first meeting given the spike in hate crimes and anti asian sentiment in the country. we wanted to capture the moment and have these discussions when the whole country had just experienced these events johal said. the concepts are more likely to hit home if the topic is fresh people are still thinking about it and are more likely to take action. zayna jan another third year student and founding member of better together created a toolkit for bystander intervention that students can review and utilize. i wanted the toolkit to be something that people can look at easily and understand quickly and for it to be dental school specific jan said. giving students the ability to share their stories has already been effective. incidents of racism are often suppressed by students of color and thus these situations can go unnoticed by the majority of dental students she added. education and open discussion is the first step and we are trying to get people involved and just listen jan said. whether people acknowledge them or not these things affect the way people treat their patients it does affect the line of work that we do and i hope that sparks something in people. dr. naty lopez is a professor in the school and is the assistant dean for admissions and diversity equity and inclusion. lopez applauded student efforts over the past year and said she looks forward to continuing the conversations. what has been so important about this last year is that we have responded to the current events as a grassroots movement instead of a top down approach lopez said. students were not just satisfied with learning about bias and discrimination they wanted to be prepared as future health care professionals to work with a diverse patient population. as of spring 2021 students pursuing a doctor of dental surgery were 62 white. the next largest racial group was asians at 12 while black and hispanic students made up around 2 of the student body respectively. lopez said that the dental school is not yet where it wants to be in terms of structural diversity within the school. many of the patients receiving care in the university dental clinics are from marginalized backgrounds. having a student body that is more reflective of that patient population is difficult because of the cost and extra preparation necessary for students to reach dental school lopez said. the projected four year cost of attendance at the school for non minnesota residents graduating in 2024 is almost 511000. for minnesota residents it is just under 343000. along with other students jan said it was conflicting to ask the dental school to admit more students of color because they believe the current environment and culture would not be entirely beneficial for those students. why would you put more students of color into an environment that they are not safe in or are not going to thrive in better together wants to host at least one monthly meeting going forward jan said. lopez said she believes the dental school s students faculty and staff have turned the last year into an opportunity for positive change. you can see the coming together of different groups and i think that is the key for the school to believe and think that this is our work not just the work of one group she said. with the advent of juneteenth johal said better together hopes to cover topics relating to the black community in the coming month. we want to continue to provide space for students to be able to share their experiences she said.

disaster,"i know there s many people out there very eager for self driving cars but i can t stress enough how important it is to wait until the technology is ready. and i can pretty comprehensively say that the technology in what appears to be an early 2000s ford crown vic is not ready which is why one was whirling out of control until a homeless daredevil leapt into action to save the day. somehow perhaps as an homage to past full sized ford transmission issues the car popped into drive hit a curb which bumped it into reverse where it stayed in gear and with the idling engine providing enough torque to begin to whip the car around in circles over and over and over. an un piloted car driving backward in circles is to put it mildly a huge problem. it s 4000 pounds of out of control moving metal and it s just a matter of time and chance before it causes real injury and or property damage. in this case any possible disaster was averted by the lightning fast reflexes of a homeless man named john vasquez who was able to jump onto the moving car open the door while perched on the hood get inside and stop it. i didn t know what was going on i heard someone screaming. i saw this car go in circles and i saw a friend of mine try to grab the door and she couldn t get it. i ran and just jumped on it. i d have hoped vasquez would have been rewarded for his heroic action in some way they re calling him homeless spiderman after all. perhaps someone who knows how to get in contact with him will set up a gofundme or something . senior editor jalopnik running 1973 vw beetle 2006 scion xb 1990 nissan pao 1991 yugo gv plus 2020 changli ev not so running 1977 dodge tioga rv also buy my book https .

labour,"handout cornwall standard freeholder postmedia network sketch of the design of the morrisburg roundabout released by the united counties of sdg in october 2020 and since revised. sdg council voted to move ahead with the morrisburg roundabout and streetscaping project on monday after considering a new bid that was million lower than one received in december. council awarded the contract to coco paving inc. headquartered in toronto but with nine sites across cornwall and sdg including an office in morrisburg at a cost of some million of the work comes from the sdg budget with million from federal provincial infrastructure funding and the balance from the municipality of south dundas. council s authorization will allow sdg staff members to meet with coco as soon as possible in order to get the construction work started right away. the project includes the replacement of the intersection of county roads 2 and 31 with a roundabout as well as reconstructing county road 2 between st. lawrence street and laurier drive. the new bid though lower than the one council balked at in december is still budgeted to come in at 440000 over the million sdg placed in the 2020 then the 2021 budget in order to pay for the county s share of the work. the recommendation placed before council monday was to cover this shortfall from the expected surplus in hot mix paving for 2021 but transportation and planning services director ben de haan told council the final overage may not come in that high. that includes some contingencies that are likely not going to be incurred but there are all sorts of project contingencies accounted for in that shortfall de haan said. it s a reasonable overall picture of what it will look like for us . we re confident the contractor is willing to work with us to lower costs further this is their home too and they have great interest. de haan noted some possible items that may not end up being needed are line items like temporary asphalt which is included in case a stretch of the project goes too long as gravel dirt. increased use of water or other dust suppressant could reduce or eliminate that need. similarly there s a contingency for managing contaminated soils which if any is found while the work is being completed has to be dealt with appropriately but none is expected. morrisburg roundabout bids come in 2 million over budget . a roundabout discussion regarding big changes coming to morrisburg . final design for morrisburg roundabout finalized . the bid was reworked from december to eliminate some items which led to the million drop in costs. these included trimming back on some pedestrian elements converting storm sewers into open ditches and trimmed back on the planned landscaping. councillors were supportive of moving forward but questioned whether using the expected surplus in the roads department s hot mix paving program to cover this shortfall was the appropriate solution. steven byvelds pointed out council only recently approved a policy to place this exact surplus into a reserve fund to help address road repairs on other county roads that need work but haven t reached the point where they are put forward for reconstruction. i know we have the extra money there however we re trying to save those dollars for those roads we ve ignored forever and we all know the list byvelds said. sdg treasurer rebecca russell noted the county expects a million balance in its working reserve once the 2020 financials are finalized and a balance of million is expected in the road resurfacing reserve. she reminder members it would be council s decision on which reserve to take the over budget amount from once those bills were due. bryan mcgillis suggested rather than hash out this detail now council could just request a report from staff members on alternate sources to pay the shortfall. south dundas council was to meet monday night to discuss the new bid given it too will have to commit to the new amount that comes over the budget it set for its part of the project.

unrest,"palestinian arab sources say the egyptian government is pressing the hamas terrorist organization not to escalate tensions with israel warning that a new round of fighting would embarrass egypt harming its position as a proxy for talks between israel and the gaza terror group. a report published by israel s channel 13 tuesday cited palestinian arab officials who said that cairo is urging hamas not to use the upcoming jerusalem flag march which marks the anniversary of the liberation of eastern jerusalem in 1967 as a pretext for attacks on israeli targets. such attempts would embarrass us and the bennett government would respond with force one official claimed egypt told hamas. the situation on the ground will dictate our next steps. as israeli security forces gear up for tuesday s flag march at least two fires were reported on the gaza frontier the result of terror bombs laden with incendiary devices launched from the gaza strip. the flag march or rikudgalim had been slated for last month on jerusalem day but was pushed off amid arab riots and hamas rocket attacks. after repeated delays the flag march is set to be held in the capital tuesday starting at 6 30 more than 2000 police officers are slated to be deployed to secure the event while extra iron dome missile defense systems have been deployed to neutralize possible rocket attacks.

science,"north american sushi nomenclature evoked locations effects shape or colour. then there s the crazy boy roll . in the long running annual series oh the humanities national post reporters survey academic scholarship at the congress of the humanities and social sciences which has gone entirely virtual this year hosted at the university of alberta from may 27 to june 4. the california roll has disputed origin stories. one has it starting in vancouver in the late 1970s with the state s abbreviation ca serendipitously standing for the roll s main ingredients crab and avocado. another places the invention in los angeles where squeamish diners trying a newly stylish foreign cuisine preferred not to see the seaweed wrapping of the traditional japanese preparation so the makizushi literally rolled sushi was served inside out showing rice with avocado standing in for raw tuna in the fish s off season. however it began it took off like pepperoni pizza and according to the new research of kiyoko toratani of york university s department of languages literatures and linguistics the california roll s name became a template for the naming of rolls as north american sushi came into its own. her theory is that the california roll was the primary example of a broader trend. in japan sushi rolls are named literally for the ingredients. but the north american sushi menu has become wildly figurative and metaphorical from the spider roll to the skydome roll and even the ex boyfriend roll. read more oh the humanities stories . everything else is secondary the social history of shawarma poutine . to study this toratani classified the menu offerings of leading sushi restaurants in san diego houston and toronto for a presentation to the canadian society for the study of names at the annual congress of the humanities and social sciences. i was amazed by the uniqueness of their names and images because they were so different from the japanese original she said monday in an interview. she explained this by reference to metonymy the linguistic concept in which one word stands for another related word as when people use the crown to refer to the monarchy. her argument is that california is an example of metonymy for avocado in which the place name stands in for the ingredient. this type of place for product metonymy became the standard menu pitch as the notion spread to include the boston roll with shrimp or the new orleans roll with crawfish. a spider roll made with deep fried soft shell crab. this template also shows up in a double metonymy such as the amigo roll which evokes mexico which in turn evokes the main ingredient avocado or the cajun roll suggesting louisiana and therefore the main ingredient oysters. this was the most common naming convention. variations include an effect for product metonymy such as the energy roll reflecting the japanese idea that eel restores energy. next common was a description of shape or colour as in caterpillar spider dragon or rainbow roll which look figuratively like their names. some referred to the diner such as the salmon lover s roll or the shrimp killer roll. one thing that stands out is how few of these names are japanese. toratani has previously studied the process by which the word sushi was naturalized into north american english first explained with a paraphrase as in sushi or rice sandwiches second as a compound element to describe a sushi bar or sushi restaurant and finally with a shift in meaning to refer more broadly to raw fish rather than the literal japanese dish with vinegared rice. for this newest work that describes the california roll as the prototypical maki name toratani surveyed the various menus and noted that almost 40 per cent of the names were words from outside the restaurant context. dragon rolls presented in the shape of a writhing dragon. so although some rolls were named with familiar menu words such as crunchy spicy or grilled many evoked stereotypical japanese notions in the north american imagination that have nothing to do with food such as the kamikaze roll sumo roll and hot geisha roll. the lion king roll is arguably somehow kenyan and the star wars roll seems even more distant from its culinary roots. nature s wonders figured prominently like tornado and magma rolls as did sex from hot night roll and s m roll to the french kiss roll. these names remind us that north american sushi rolls were born in restaurants as many of them adopt naming strategies for the purpose of getting the diner s attention toratani said. this contrasts starkly with japanese naming conventions which rely on the literal ingredient and as toratani explained carry the implication of home cookery. we don t have to sell the sushi roll that s why we just use the ingredient for the name she said. the california roll was a product of north american chefs having to pitch an unfamiliar concept in which the literal description was less effective than the figurative. it caught on so well that it started to change the cuisine itself. i think this sushi roll has a life of its own that s just evolving continuously toratani said noting that some menus now list an option in which a california roll is deep fried called a crazy boy roll. for japanese frying sushi is just crazy she said.

weather,"two washington electric utilities buffeted by serious power line fires during last september s windstorms have opted not to develop plans for public safety power shut offs that could be used to prevent the ignition of such blazes. during those windstorms a fire started by a sparking avista corp. line destroyed 121 homes in the malden area of eastern washington. others that flared in western washington destroyed seven homes in an area of pierce county served by puget sound energy. during a may 26 public meeting convened by the state utilities and transportation commission officials with the two utilities outlined a range of measures for the 2021 season that includes surveillance to spot hazard trees pole replacement and maintenance to keep branches off lines. the officials said the fire prevention measures currently in place should be enough to reduce the risks. currently public safety power shut off is not in our tool kit said dave james who manages avista s wildfire resiliency program. dan koch pse s vice president of operations said the majority of the utility s service territory lies in low to moderate risk wildfire areas and the company is hardening lines in the higher risk areas to make fires less likely. at least for now the company is not considering public safety power shutdowns. in oregon and california all the investor owned utilities regulated by state utility commissions have developed such plans as has the portland based bonneville power administration which operates a regional northwest transmission network. these plans map out strategies during times of extreme risk to preemptively de energize lines so they won t spark if they are blown down or struck by trees. these actions are controversial since they can leave customers without power for days on end but have taken on increased importance as power line ignitions have been found to be the cause of some of the region s worst fires. in oregon the state public utility commission informally requested in 2018 that all three of the state s regulated power companies develop these plans. and earlier this month the commission issued temporary rules to regulate how they are carried out according to kandi young a commission spokeswoman. so far washington s utilities and transportation commission has chosen not to require the three regulated power companies to develop public safety power cutoff plans. and only one of these utilities pacific power pacificorp has opted to adapt one for service areas prone to wildfires. at the may 26 meeting the washington commission chair praised the preparations of the state s investor owned power utilities. i know that in other states their commissions are actually developing rules doing a little more of what i would call maybe this is the wrong word micromanaging said david danner chair of the washington utilities and transportation commission. but their involvement is certainly getting more significant. so we will be having conversations about what ours should be. in a statement released after the meeting a utility spokesperson said the commission has not proposed one size fits all rules as it expects the utilities to fulfill their requirements to provide safe and reliable service. in washington last year weather forecasts in early september predicted extreme fire risk amid hot temperatures low humidity and strong east winds. 7 8 at least 47 blazes were started by power lines according to a seattle times analysis of data from the department of natural resources and other sources as well as interviews with fire officials in whitman and pierce counties. the most damaging fire erupted in the avista service area after a treetop from outside the utility s right of way fell on a line. sparks ignited brush then winds created walls of flame that races across fields toward malden whitman county. avista officials say that in 2021 they have a robust plan that is appropriate for our service territory to prevent power line fires according to a statement from a company spokesperson. this plan includes an expanded effort to identify and remove trees that might fall on lines and a technology that can be put into place that limits the automatic reclosing of circuits when there is a disturbance on the line such as a blown fuse. if the circuits are not reclosed then power is shut off to the area downstream from the disturbance until the area can be inspected. though it doesn t make fire ignition risk zero it is the lowest we can possibly achieve without preemptively de energizing a circuit james said at the meeting. pacificorp however has taken a different approach developing a public safety power shutdown as a last ditch option during extreme weather in an area northwest of yakima as well as areas in oregon and california where it provides service. at the may 26 public hearing a pacific power official said he did not anticipate the utility having to use the option this year in washington. but it is part of the tool kit. we are prepared to do it if it gets there said allen berreth pacific power s vice president of operations. in oregon pacific power lines run through some of the areas hardest hit by september wildfires. in an area east of salem the company had a plan in place for public safety power shutdowns and now is a defendant in lawsuits that cite the failure to cut off the electricity as evidence of negligence. in a statement last fall drew hanson a pacificorp spokesperson said the company does not discuss pending litigation. we continue to work alongside our own third party investigators to fully understand the impact of one of the biggest and far reaching windstorms we ve seen in our 110 year history hanson said.

politics,"ice announced on friday that it was shuttering the victim of immigration crime engagement office and replacing it with a new program to provide victim support regardless of immigration status of the victim or perpetrator. all people regardless of their immigration status should be able to access victim services without fear homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas said in a statement. acting ice director tae johnson echoed those comments saying that ice is committed to serving all victims of crime. the trump administration launched the victim support office in april 2017 as a fulfillment of the then president s executive order on immigration. formation of the office followed trump s repeated public comments linking immigrants and criminals most notably a speech in which he referred to mexicans as criminals and rapists. critics said at the time that the office was part of several measures that would skew public opinion against immigrants. then homeland security secretary john kelly said the goal of the office was to give resources and support to families that he said previously felt unheard. the biden administration s replacement program called the victims engagement and services line will include guidance on visas for immigrants who are victims of crimes or human trafficking. since president joe biden took office ice has taken several steps to reverse or modify agency policy under the trump administration. shortly after biden took office his administration rolled out ice guidelines focusing the agency s law enforcement measures more narrowly on immigrants who pose a national security border security or public safety risk. the new guidance was prompted by an executive order and marked a return to obama era immigration enforcement measures based on a priority system instead of the more aggressive approach taken under the trump administration. and earlier this year ice said it would no longer issue fines to undocumented immigrants who have failed to depart the united states a reversal from the trump era policy that threatened immigrants with thousands of dollars in debt to the federal government. the agency rescinded the two orders on the collection of financial penalties after determining the policy to be ineffective announcing it intended to cancel fines already issued to undocumented immigrants.

politics,"midlands voices these immigration proposals deserve support from fischer sasse . we all like to think of our state as unique and in a lot of ways nebraska truly is. founded in 1867 our state has a proud history of working the land building relationships helping neighbors and welcoming strangers all of which make it different. but nebraska is not unique in the benefits it derives from immigrants and i m calling on sens. deb fisher and ben sasse to stand up for our state and our nation in support of two bills that have already passed in the house the american dream and promise act 6 and the farm workforce modernization act 1603 . we sent our senators to congress to act in the best interests of nebraskans and these bills will do exactly that. passing the american dream and promise act and the farm workforce modernization act will strengthen our state s families and economy and live up to our values. by providing a pathway to citizenship for dreamers young people who came or were brought to the united states as children as well as recipients of temporary protected status tps and deferred enforced departure ded who are nationals of countries that were designated for protection due to environmental disaster or civil conflict the american dream and promise act would offer a sense of safety and security to folks who have been productive members of our local and national economy often for decades. there is not currently a way for them to get citizenship but there should be. the other bill the farm workforce modernization act would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented agricultural workers revise the h 2a agricultural worker program and impose mandatory employment verification through the e verify program in agriculture. these improvements would stabilize the farm labor force and ensure greater food safety and security for the country. during the pandemic it became incredibly clear how essential frontline workers truly are and nothing is more frontline than our fields and farms where our food comes from. farmers businesses and worker organizations agree on this bill it is a huge step forward for nebraska and the nation as a whole. i have worked as an immigration attorney in omaha for over 25 years and i know firsthand how important immigrants are to our local and state economy. immigrants are a critical component of the nebraskan labor force. according to the american immigration council 18 of the state s life physical and social science professionals are immigrants as are 22 of nebraskans working in production occupations. immigrant led households in nebraska paid million in federal taxes and million in state and local taxes in 2018. immigrants are our neighbors business owners taxpayers and co workers who are an integral part of nebraska s diverse and thriving communities and make extensive contributions that benefit all. but beyond that i also know that americans overwhelmingly support providing permanent legal status and a path to citizenship for unauthorized people who have made this country their home and are working hard and contributing to its prosperity and safety during the covid 19 pandemic. two thirds of americans favor allowing all unauthorized immigrants to obtain legal status and apply for citizenship and even more of them support dreamers and agricultural workers receiving citizenship. fisher and sasse to understand that we want immigration solutions that unite and serve our state and national interest. sure i would like to see even more reforms since our immigration laws have not been updated in more than a generation. but success on these bills is a step in the right direction that will build momentum for congress to take further strides to modernize the rest of our immigration system giving us a smart workable plan forward. mark j. curley is the managing partner at an omaha law firm specializing in immigration law. he and his team have been assisting

disaster,"a reader emailed recently to suggest that i should focus less in my columns on safety as it takes the fun away from being outdoors. i do always consider that too much factor when i write or talk about safety but i ve also seen enough injuries and dead bodies especially early in my career when i was a game warden to let one person or complaint change my tune. safety and habitat are two important topics to most of us who spend time in the outdoors. if you don t have a safe fishing boating or hunting trip it doesn t matter how many hours you spend on the pontoon if you bring home a limit of fish or tag a trophy buck. i grew up in the 1980s when recommendations for seatbelt use were turning into laws and people were trying to adjust to the process of having to click in before driving off. while it s impossible to plan the best time to wear a seat belt or not . it just makes sense to wear one all the time. the premise for wearing a personal flotation device while in a boat isn t much different. while regulations don t require mandatory wearing of pfds for anyone age 11 or older on north dakota waters if an accident does happen it s usually too late for the pfd to do any good. it certainly isn t surprising that national statistics show failure to wear a pfd is the main reason people lose their lives in water recreation accidents. north dakota law requires all children ages 10 and younger to wear a personal flotation device at all times while in boats of less than 27 feet in length. state law also requires an approved pfd on board for older passengers and all personal watercraft users must wear a life jacket as well as anyone towed on skis tubes boards or other similar devices. water skiers and tubers should wear a life jacket with four nylon straps rather than one with a zipper because straps are stronger than zippers upon impact with water. anglers or anyone paddling a canoe should opt for a pfd that is comfortable enough to wear for an entire outing. water skiers and tubers are reminded it takes three to ski and tube. when a person is towed on water skis or a similar device an observer other than the operator is required on the vessel or the personal watercraft is equipped with a mirror on each side which provides the operator an unobstructed field of vision to the rear. for a reminder on regulations that will help ensure safe boating this summer the north dakota boat and water safety guide is available online at the game and fish website by email at or at a local game and fish department office. featured photo whether fishing or recreating life jackets keep boaters safe.

environmental,"oregon voters should feel pretty good about sen. jeff merkley s ideas on forest management concepts he discussed last week. merkley wants to push the biden administration to spend at least 1 billion per year for logging proscribed burns and other work to get the tinderbox forests of the state in shape to withstand disease and uncontrolled blazes. forest management are the key words merkley used and we hope that is exactly what happens. forest management is not closure of forests. it does not mean blockading vast tracts of forest land to watch it die and then become kindling for another massive fire. instead merkley seems to back a cooperative concept where traditional rivals such as the timber industry and conservation groups work together to help forests. merkley correctly pointed out that in the 2018 federal farm bill he included authorization to double spending on forest collaborative projects. that is just not idle talk. that is putting hard cash behind a concept that is probably the only way we can move forward in the future. merkley s next challenge will be to get the money into the forest service budget. meanwhile merkley s focus on cooperative projects has great merit. it seems obvious even to the most pessimistic observer of the forest situation in the northwest the only way forward will be through collaboration. that isn t going to be an easy sell for either environmental or timber advocates but it is the way to the future. for a special interest group such as the timber industry or an environmentalist group to believe they can have it all one way simply is not a viable solution. in fact it is a roadblock that pushes important matters such as the health of our forests away and puts the focus on egos. the cooperative model is one that will be we think utilized on rangeland as well. for too long there was a winner takes all mentality regarding natural resources issues. on one side stood the timber advocates on the other countless environmental groups. both sides believed they were right and both could conjure up data and rhetoric to make it all seem real. fact is none of that matters when the broader problem of forest and range management is placed firmly into focus. what matters is finding compromise and solutions. fighting over dogma is not going to get us to where we want to be in terms of forest health. good sound planning will.

social,a thayer father will spend time in prison after admitting he was high on heroin while his two young sons drowned in the kankakee river. eric patillo 36 was sentenced to 16 years in the indiana department of corrections on wednesday. judge samuel cappas ordered him into a 9 month drug rehab program. if he completes it the judge could revise his sentence but he did not guarantee it would be changed. patillo signed a plea agreement april 19 dropping his charges to two counts of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury level 3 felonies. both counts had an 8 year maximum. the emotionally charged hearing wednesday orbited around eight minutes of body cam footage prosecutors played that appeared to show both boys lifeless bodies. patillo took his two sons levi 4 and evan 2 to the river aug. 21 2018 after dropping their mother savannah sanders off at work. fisherman dylan sherwood testified he remembered that day like the back of my hand . patillo showed up around 2 21 2018 with the boys at the river without fishing gear he said. his friend directly asked him if he was on something after patillo appeared to be nodding off and stuck his finger while trying to put bait on the pole they let him borrow. they called 911 on patillo when he admitted he was on boy heroin while his two kids were running around near the river. sherwood and a friend were unloading gear to fish and stay overnight when realizing he hadn t heard the boys for a few minutes he testified. as they went back they saw a pair of hands and knees floating in the river. the other child was submerged he said. his friend pulled out one child while sherwood started chest compressions he said. then patillo yelled for his friend still in the truck who ran over pulled the second child out then took off running. the second man was not charged. the boys were unresponsive when pulled from the river. at the time patillo said that he was beyond sorry and that his life is expletive over an affidavit stated. relatives said then the younger boy may have gone into the water first with his big brother following to protect him. patillo was on probation at the time of the boys deaths after he pleaded guilty in may 2018 to possession of a narcotic drug a level 6 felony in a newton county court case. the warrant was recently withdrawn. newton county sheriff s deputy ryan halloway said he first met patillo after he was called to his house during a oct. 21 2017 heroin overdose. sanders was also high on heroin he said. patillo was transported to the hospital. prosecutor bernard johnsen played footage from halloway s body cam showing both boys who appeared lifeless at the riverbed while he frantically picked up one child to attempt cpr. throughout the footage halloway yelled at patillo telling him to get back multiple times at one point threatening to take him to jail. about eight minutes of the half hour video was shown before defense lawyer robert varga objected. sherwood sat quietly near the back weeping. at least two women left the courtroom who did not appear to be relatives. patillo bowed his head down and closed his eyes. halloway emotional and whose hands were physically shaking at times also looked down as it was played. we know what the result is varga said objecting. if they have a point . did anything else happen on the tape cappas asked. i just wanted the court to see what happened johnsen said. as halloway exited from his testimony cappas called out to him motioning to patillo. sanders texted and left two voicemails for varga that day but did not appear for her testimony on patillo s behalf. she had attended multiple prior hearings and testified in favor of lowering his bond. eric is a good father varga said offering what sanders said previously. the boys were the light of his life. sanders herself was a recovering addict but was not responsible for what happened he said. she did not want to see him languish in prison over this varga said. johnsen responding was sorry sanders did not attend. i was hoping she would be here he said. she gave the children to someone she knew was a heroin addict and junkie. they had a better chance surviving playing with a loaded pistol than at the river with their father he said. that s how bad that situation was. look at what happened he said. they died. the state of indiana has to be their voice. she is just as guilty as he is johnsen said with his voice rising. what did you think was going to happen they are graveyard dead. he asked for patillo to get the maximum 16 year sentence in the department of corrections. what happened was a tragic accident varga said. in 21 years of being an attorney this is easily the most emotional and heart wrenching case i ve been a part of he said. it s anger. anger at the thought that two boys lost their lives. mr patillo has not denied responsibility here. vilifying sanders was a bridge too far varga said. patillo has been in custody for nearly three years. the body cam footage is replayed in his head every day he said. the defendant tried heroin first at age 26 soon becoming addicted varga said. struggling with addiction should not be a factor used against him in court he argued. what is going to be the appropriate punishment for a man who s lost his children and had to see them die in front of him to see it for the rest of his life patillo had seven contacts with law enforcement previously. his drug arrests were not violent and what happened at the river was unlikely to happen again his lawyer said. he doesn t have any more kids he can t take care of johnsen retorted later in court. they re lost. varga asked for three years. patillo needed drug rehabilitation his lawyer said. he spent three years in jail with minimal mental health counseling which was nearly impossible especially after covid 19 restrictions. patillo wanted to get out and work with other addicts share his story. that s admirable varga said. it just doesn t go away patillo said who cried through his statement. there s a lot of people that have to deal with what happened halloway sherwood his family sanders he said. patillo hoped his story would help someone else. the case was one of the worst things i ve seen cappas said agreeing with varga. the judge had to balance patillo s addiction with the tragedy of his two sons deaths. i could give him 100 years that s not going to be as bad as the anguish for his actions that day cappas said. patillo was not trustworthy due to his heroin addiction the judge said. if he got out with minimal drug counseling and mental health treatment he would be extremely tempted to relapse and probably overdose he said. in the end patillo received 8 years on each count to run consecutively with a mandatory drug program stint that could lead to a revised sentence. varga said he planned to appeal. the boys mostly lived with their grandparents due to drug use in the parents home according to the indiana department of child services 2018 child abuse and neglect fatalities report. they had not been removed prior to their deaths. patillo picked the boys up from the grandparents home before he took them to the river it said. 
weather,"nature based solutions offer a way forward. the twin crises of nature loss and climate change are inextricably linked. for too long however biodiversity loss and climate change have been discussed and dealt with in siloes even by independent international frameworks of the un convention on biological diversity and the un framework convention on climate change. however we may be at an important turning point. for the first time intergovernmental scientific bodies for each global challenge the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes have worked together on a report the result of a co sponsored workshop of 50 climate and biodiversity experts. the report finds that we can either solve both crises or solve neither. why does addressing nature loss matter . these impacts all contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss. as these crises worsen they reinforce one another. for example changes in temperature or rainfall due to a changing climate can cause loss of habitats and deplete ecosystems of their sustenance. related biodiversity loss then can reduce nature s ability to store carbon thus exacerbating climate change. both of these are not only problems for the environment but have grave consequences on human wellbeing and livelihoods particularly relating to public health and food security. if we continue to address climate change and biodiversity loss separately we will continue to take one step forward and two steps back. for example quick fixes for storing carbon such as planting non native trees can promote monoculture plantations that run the risk of eradicating biodiversity and ecosystem services which could have damaging and expensive repercussions on livelihoods and our health. the good news is that solutions that reduce such trade offs exist. to halt climate change and biodiversity loss we need to combine emission reduction interventions with those that allow nature to flourish such as nature based solutions nbs . for example when transforming land for renewable energy an integrated approach would include grazing and cropping around solar panels simultaneously providing benefits to pollinators and other wildlife while producing food and clean energy. other win win scenarios highlighted in the report include halting deforestation in biodiversity hotspots and carbon rich ecosystems such as rainforests peatlands and mangroves. according to the report we use more than 50 percent of all land on earth for food and timber production. therefore transitioning to net zero nature positive practices in the agriculture and forestry sectors also would provide significant co benefits for climate nature and people. nbs can help both reduce emissions and increase our resilience to unavoidable future shocks. nbs could provide 37 percent of co2 mitigation needed by 2030 to maintain global warming within degrees fahrenheit and at a lower cost than other options. marine and terrestrial ecosystems are the only carbon sinks we have and have the capacity to absorb the equivalent of some 60 percent of global man made emissions with the potential to do even more. equally wetlands and forests can secure water supplies during droughts trees can help to cool down cities during heatwaves and mangroves can protect against coastal floods. research shows that investing in nature could provide 395 million jobs by 2030 and the covid 19 pandemic has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to reset humanity s relationship with the environment. the decisions citizens business and governments take in the near future will shape the world for decades to come. recovery packages should be combined with strong actions including removing harmful subsidies that do not serve the public good and supporting people with the necessary training and reskilling in green jobs. a recent study found that every 1 spent by both the public and private sectors on addressing climate change and biodiversity loss can generate up to 7 worth of return. the world economic forum is committed to strengthening the link between the climate and nature agendas. its community of champions for nature is promoting an integrated land and oceans management to deliver a resilient economy and equitable society. the forum s nature action agenda also recently launched two initiatives that are promoting net zero nature positive transformations in the urban and food systems which are top drivers of ghg emissions and biodiversity loss 100 million farmers and biodivercities by 2030. if we continue to address climate change and biodiversity loss separately we will continue to take 1 step forward and 2 steps back. nature is an important ally in the fight against climate change and addressing nature loss together with climate change offers wide benefits for businesses and jobs as we face further environmental economic and health shocks. net zero nature positive economies not only would reduce the likelihood of future pandemics but also safeguard against future crises. awareness of the dangers of climate change has never been higher and since the start of the pandemic which found people locked up indoors people have yearned for and connected with nature as never before. let us not forget these lessons and ensure that we urgently opt for solutions to global challenges that learn from the complex harmony of the natural world rather than simplifying it to unsustainable outcomes. while the integration of climate change and nature in policymaking and business strategy is not where it should be the message is clear the longevity of our societies and economies depends on it.

weather,"josh brasted getty images a new conservation strategy unveiled earlier this spring by the national park service is very much against the idea that we can keep things as they were  one nps official recently told newsweek. a joshua tree is pictured in the photo above at joshua tree national park on january 28  2021. for the first time since the founding of the national park service nps   the government agency is no longer approaching park management with the belief that all species  ecosystems and landscapes can be preserved as they currently exist. the change in conservation strategy has actually been coming for a while as a direct result of climate change  according to gregor schuurman  an ecologist at the nps climate change response program. the press of climate change is not letting up any time soon. in fact  it s intensifying  and predicted to keep doing so  schuurman told newsweek. this push is very much against the idea that we can keep things as they were. the nps unveiled its 80 page plan of attack for what it refers to as climate smart planning and management earlier this spring. the plan was developed in partnership with the national wildlife federation nwf and is intended to serve as a guide for the country s more than 400 parks  which encompass more than 84 million acres throughout the country. bruce stein  a nwf scientist who co wrote the guide  said the rapidly changing climate threatens to undermine decades of conservation work in our national parks  according to a nps news release. stein added that the proposed climate smart approach will be key to safeguarding wildlife and other park resources in a warming and increasingly uncertain future. what is the paris climate agreement . the new strategy was developed organically as nps officials worked with parks across the ' schuurman said. while the nps has always emphasized the importance of keeping things natural  climate change  he said that can be tied to human activity has accelerated some of the natural environmental changes that organizations like the nps grew to expect. there s always been some dynamism  but human activity intensifies that  schuurman said. we have to manage for change and not just for persistence. he said the nps published its new guide as a way to advise parks around the country on how to make increasingly difficult park management decisions. opinions on any given park s most concerning vulnerabilities vary from one person to the next  he said  but the guide can help park officials with the triaging process. robert alexander getty images a national park service sign welcomes visitors to joshua tree national park in california on february 27  2019. as an example  schuurman said if a species is only considered moderately threatened by climate change but plays a vital role in its larger ecosystem  that species may take top priority over a species that is more seriously threatened  but on which its ecosystem is not as dependent. like individual species  parks vary in terms of the extent to which they are under threat. parks located in the american southwest are among those that are pretty darn vulnerable due to drought  warming temperatures and wildfire risk  schuurman said. during a recent interview with kpbs  schuurman discussed the really difficult situation at joshua tree national park  which is located just over 100 miles east of los angeles in southern california. despite the drought and warming temperatures threatening some species at joshua tree  schuurman said others may be able to thrive as those conditions intensify a possibility that christian delich  who works as one of the park s climate educators  echoed. as it continues to get warmer and a bit drier in the mojave desert  certain species within the park are going to be able to take advantage of those conditions and actually expand  delich told newsweek. other species are likely to face more difficulties in surviving the changing climate  delich said. that does n t necessarily mean that the species will go extinct  but they could eventually disappear from the parks in which they currently thrive. at joshua tree  delich said horned lizards are among the species considered very vulnerable as the climate continues to dry out and heat up. robert alexander getty images a dead  fallen joshua tree decomposes on the ground in joshua tree national park in california on february 27  2019. i m worried about the future of pinyon pines within the park  of california juniper  of horned lizards  even the creosote bush a lot of those species that maybe the average visitor might not see as important in comparison with the trees for which the park was named  delich said. meanwhile  global climate models are predicting a sharp decline by 2100 in the joshua tree population  he said. the trees were granted temporary endangered species status last fall  but delich said he still finds the limited number of joshua tree seedlings seen throughout the park worrying. joshua trees are not unique to joshua tree national park  but delich said they used to occupy a much larger chunk of territory 15 000 to 20 000 years ago. giant sequoia trees are another example of a species that used to span several western states but are now secluded to a region along the western sierra nevada. these kinds of shifts are natural  delich said. but climate change spurred on by the burning of fossil fuels and co2 emissions have caused that to accelerate  he added. every species on planet earth comes and goes nothing lasts forever  delich said. even though it is not the nps job to make huge decisions that could impact an entire ecosystem s future the nps is not supposed to interfere  as delich said tangible human impacts can be difficult for the agency to overlook. on a smaller scale  delich said park rangers occasionally revegetate areas that some among the park s nearly million annual visitors drive through while in search of parking. but schuurman said climate change necessitates a more unified and forward looking response. josh brasted getty images a joshua tree is photographed in joshua tree national park on january 30  2021. if the conditions climatically that used to sustain a suite of species have shifted  then efforts to sustain the historical ecological condition may very well come at the expense of keeping others as they historically were  because the context has changed  he said. as an example  schuurman described a hypothetical conundrum about how to help cool water fish survive in a stream that is growing warmer. doing so may require increasing the amount of shade in the area  which may require planting additional trees along the stream s edge. some of these hypothetical scenarios are possible  schuurman said  but all potential impacts on the ecosystem in question need to be taken into account before any decisions are made  and that s a tricky task since climate change is manipulating the extenuating factors so quickly. that s where we think trying to hold on can lead you to some difficult choices that begin to challenge the larger values of what you re trying to do in the first place  schuurman said. as parks work to implement the nps new conservation strategy  schuurman said careful consideration will be needed every step of the "" "

religion,"amc entertainment s shares on monday were too fast and too furious for short sellers while dave buster s stock play mentions on community investing platforms elicited some skepticism. f9 the ninth installment of vin diesel s fast furious franchise pulled down 70 million over its opening weekend after opting for a theater only release potentially marking a major turning point for a film industry that turned to a streaming model during the ravages of the covid pandemic. it has been hard to find any group of investors more thrilled by the continuing financial success of the movie franchise led by fictional hero dom toretto and his merry group of corona drinking street racers than retail investors committed to holding shares of amc. the diesel powered f9 weekend box office helped amc shares climb as high as 9 monday before the stock gave back some of those gains as investors used the stellar ticket sales as evidence that the reported death of movie theaters has been greatly exaggerated. adam aron the increasingly social media savvy chief executive of amc tweeted monday morning. aron s tweet to which he attached an image of an f9 poster featuring the films s star studded cast went on to credit f9 s gangbuster opening with bringing 2 million americans into amc s theaters over the weekend and million globally. both record numbers since re opening our theatres aron declared. aron who has made a habit of engaging directly with amc s individual investor fan base offering free popcorn and other perks to amc hodlers aka long term holders definitely got a response from the reddit crowd. i did a capitalism responded rhino57 to a post of aron s tweet on reddit board amcstock. i went and supported amc this weekend after market close on friday and got the biggest tub of popcorn they had . while aron s tweet also elicited some complaints that a resurgent summer box office should delay his plan to sell 25 million new shares redditors would be pleased to see that f9 s success had little effect on short sellers. according to fintel data the stock remains in the top 200 short squeeze targets of the almost 9000 companies tracked by the site. even the addition of pro wrestler turned movie star john cena to the franchise didn t spook the shorts as amc s short interest remained at identical to friday. pleased to see amc short sellers those betting for a fall in value of the company s shares right where they claim to want them one individual investor indulged in film criticism of f9 to lay out their case for amc s hotstocksummer. just imagine what would have happened if it was actually a good movie too mused data dealer speculating that the return of the marvel cinematic universe as the knockout punch black widow should do record numbers period not record covid numbers. amc s spiritual meme twin also had a positive day. gamestop gme shares closed up on the day despite a decision from baird to cease coverage with analyst colin sebastian writing in a note that the company s lack of a clear plan and lack of fundamental impetus have made it too difficult for him to give a reasonable stock rating recommendation to institutional investors. meanwhile like a lonely 20 something with a hankering for blue drinks buffalo wings and a nasty big buck hunter addiction retail investors also were obsessing over dave buster s or at least someone wanted it to look that way. shares in the sports bar cum video arcade restaurant chain were a very hot topic on reddit boards monday with mentions of the ticker symbol play soaring 26700 according to hypeequity and trading volume had already exceeded its daily average two hours before the closing bell. but even with that action dave buster s stock ended lower. this comes as reddit arguments touting the chain as a cheap re opening trade target were met with skepticism by users who saw the sudden burst of interest as evidence of a possible pump and dump scheme rather than a bona fide meme inspired gambit. there was no real news around the restaurant chain on monday and short interest on the stock remained minimal. additionally the flurry of reddit posts promoting the stock appeared on multiple subreddits creating what appeared to be a false surge in popularity. backing up that skepticism was the fact that two of the top five keywords associated with dave buster s posts were pump and dump. getting kinda bored with the fake management shilling has been stocks just for a little more pump before they dump complained thecolorlesspill on reddit. just more evidence that wallstreetbets has been bought out.

humanInterest,"growing cbd hemp flowers in your house have been made entirely possible with the development of technology and the ever growing recourse online. here are some of the tips from the professionals on how to grow hemp through a vegetative state   and how to ensure the proper conditions to grow flowers to get cbd. hemp is a member of the cannabis sativa l. plant species  which has enjoyed popularity because one of the more famous members is marijuana. while both hemp and marijuana come from the same species they contain very unique biological structures which make them two very different plants. marijuana plants produce dense  thick buds and grow very bushy  hemp plants are very thin and tall  and don t produce the buds that marijuana is famous for. if you take a closer look at both plants in a side by side comparison  there is no mistaking one from the other. ultimately  the difference that is of the biggest interest is in the amount of the cannabinoid that each contains marijuana can contain up to 30 of thc  while hemp plants contain less than 1 thc. this raises the question what is hemp used for hemp was usually grown for industrial purposes for making fibers   nutritional seeds used to make hemp seed oil  but most recently it s grown for cbd cannabidiol . the cbd industry has exploded in recent years and is estimated to be worth over 20 billion by the year 2022  and with the recent legal changes in the us  there are plenty of parties interested in growing cbd hemp flowers. let s take a look at how to make this possible in your own house. since both hemp and marijuana are different forms of cannabis  the principles for growing each plant are essentially the same. first and foremost  seed selection is a crucial step that will give your crop the best genetic advantage. once you have reliable seeds in your hand  it s time to start growing the hemp in a very controlled environment. even though it s usually been grown outdoors  there are many ways to make this possible within the realm of your own house. this has also become a preferred method since it can be cultivated year round and won t face the limitations of a defined growing season. this

where you wish to grow hemp the square footage . next  you should purchase the appropriate number of grow lights such as hid lights high intensity discharge which are most commonly used. as the creators of the premium difference note  two of the most common models of hid lights are hps high pressure sodium or mh metal halide models  both of which should have appropriate reflective hoods and ballasts. other popular options are led lights since they are usually cheaper than hid lights. furthermore  they can also lower operating costs since they consume less energy. with these essential elements in place  all you have to do is focus on maintaining the following growing conditions. six parameters need to be maintained in the proper margins for a hemp flower to grow properly. firstly  the temperature needs to be maintained between 68 77 degrees f since hemp requires slightly cooler temperatures. secondly  relative humidity needs to be in the 40 50 range when the plants are flowering and is essential for flower growth. additional factors include air circulation  light for flowering  water  and feed  which are very important to consider as to not kill the hemp plant or prevent it from flowering. this is something that should be avoided if you re looking to grow cbd flowers. air circulation is necessary to remove fungus gnats and other leaf fungal diseases. in addition to this  the circulating air will cool plants too. as for the lighting conditions  after the vegetative growth  the plants should be triggered to flower by changing the photoperiod 12 hours on 12 hours off. two additional aspects are watering and feeding. do not over water the plants when they are flowering  but also don t allow them to keep drying out. a liquid fertilizer needs to be used after the vegetative growth period  which provides less nitrogen and more potassium and phosphorus to support the """

religion,"new south wales has not been subjected to that the same way melbourne has . we have seen again the return of the panic buying though i do think it will be short lived adams told the sydney morning herald and the age s dominic powell on monday. dr melissa norberg deputy director of the centre for emotional health at macquarie university has researched hoarding and panic buying behaviour. she says the drive to stockpile comes from our deep psychological attachment to things in times of crisis. she says the scarcity heuristic principle gives us a false sense that something in short supply must be more valuable so we seek it out more. she says herd mentality plays a role as does human beings inherent intolerance of uncertainty . the authorities say the lockdown will be two weeks but you think it s probably going to be six weeks so do i need to buy enough goods . but people are not engaging in full problem solving she says. in these situations we can sometimes listen to our anxious thoughts over reason and facts. although there s no specific scientific explanation norberg thinks it plays into people s health response. part of what encourages panic buying is a fear of getting covid 19 it s not just about perceived scarcity. if you have stronger fears about getting sick you ll be more inclined to buy the toilet paper she says. norberg who will speak on the science of letting go at the upcoming vivid sydney festival says australians spend billion each year on goods and services that are never or rarely used. as a society we have an over reliance on possessions . so when pandemics happen we have 20 40 60 years of learning that possessions make us feel safe make us feel good she says. if we had less reliance on possessions we may not be in this position regarding panic buying . as a society we have an over reliance on possessions. dr melissa norberg deputy director of the centre for emotional health at macquarie university . to counter this behaviour norberg suggests processes such as stocktaking one s pantry and meal planning to curb excessive and wasteful purchasing and having compassion for those unable to readily access goods such as the elderly or people with disabilities. remind yourself that it s not just about you she says. people are sick of the we are in this together talk but really try to remember that panic buying is selfish . so you have to do the opposite. it s about sticking to a list . and learning to sit with that uncertainty. she says some self reflection on previous lockdown experiences can also countenance bad behaviour. was it the toilet paper and pasta that got you through last time or was it the zoom games phone calls with friends and the walks .

disaster,"james harbor and his pup shiloh are on a mission to save dogs from the same fate shiloh would have met had it not been for his devoted owner. harbor was a plano police officer who lost his two labrador retrievers in 2014. i went eight months without a dog he says. then in may 2015 he got a call from a friend at a shelter in decatur asking him to foster a dog. harbor was dog sitting his daughter s dog and hesitated about bringing a new pup home. before he knew it the shelter had euthanized the dog. three weeks later his friend asked him about fostering another dog who was listed as no. 1 on the kill list that week. james didn t waste any time and picked up a 6 month old puppy named shiloh a mix of great pyrenees australian cattle dog golden retriever and terrier. shiloh was tagged for rescue to be delivered from decatur texas to joliet ill. harbor knew that being transported would be traumatic for her. james harbor helps logan fessler 12 place several rescue puppies into a cage for transport from the wise county animal shelter in decatur to their new homes in illinois and wisconsin. we love dogs and want to run our own animal shelter when we re older fessler says of herself and her sister. brandon wade special contributor . so i talked to the rescue shelter about keeping her permanently the plano resident says. she had come so far in the time i had fostered her. shiloh arrived at the right time in harbor s life. he had been in law enforcement for 31 1 2 years in plano and retired dec. he learned that rescue shelters pay transporters between 75 and 100 to transport dogs usually with 100 crates on a truck. so harbor proposed a business plan to lori armes a volunteer at the wise county animal shelter in decatur what if we formed a nonprofit and supported it with donations harbor wanted to deliver rescue dogs to people for free. the shelter could designate the dogs for rescue and then transport them to families who wanted to adopt them. armes and harbor joined forces and shiloh s road to hope was born. their mission is to connect dogs who have no chance in a high kill shelter with rescue groups committed to finding them loving homes. and the cost is minimal. james harbor arrives at the wise county animal shelter in decatur with his dog shiloh riding in the passenger seat. brandon wade special contributor . no one makes a dime we just get reimbursed for our expenses. we don t charge anyone harbor says. in 2016 the nonprofit s first year of operation 201 dogs were delivered to new homes. the numbers increased steadily each year to 1081 in 2019 before a dip to 763 in the pandemic year. harbor who came down with a mild case of covid 19 didn t want to put his drivers at risk. these days harbor and his other drivers primarily deliver dogs to illinois wisconsin and minnesota. the nonprofit now has two rvs and a board of directors of which harbor is president. armes says they are fortunate to have the help of a veterinarian whose clinic provides health checks and prepares health certificates for all out of state transports. armes and the partner shelters communicate on social media by posting descriptions and photos of the dogs and chronicling successful deliveries. shiloh harbor notes goes on 80 of the trips. she sits in the front seat. he says he has built her a platform with a bed but she doesn t usually go to sleep while he drives. if i m awake she keeps up. she s usually exhausted when we are done and once the other dogs are unloaded she beats me to bed harbor says. during blizzards and bad weather shiloh stays with harbor s sister in law. harbor says he averages 20 to 23 dogs in crates inside the motor home. the reason we drive rvs is so that we can see and hear the dogs. i tell every one of my drivers you don t stop except to go to the bathroom and get gas. the dogs are your priority they are on the top of the . angie hull a volunteer for shiloh s road to hope walks bandit before he is loaded onto an rv for transport to a new home in either illinois or wisconsin. brandon wade special contributor . harbor recently transported 29 dogs including two great pyrenees one german shepherd one siberian

animals. and even after a long drive the kennels are always clean. i m very grateful that they ve chosen us as a partner. patricia latham is a volunteer and board member with san angelo based concho valley paws another partner shelter. shiloh s road to hope has been successfully transporting dogs who have been sitting in our shelter forever. we are big fans latham says. last month harbor

in santa monica calif. on june 25 2018. the nba legend serves as an executive producer and narrator of the one hour documentary fight the power the movements that changed america which airs june 19 on the history channel. los angeles ap kareem abdul jabbar is an nba legend but the man known for his trademark skyhook shot has also devoted his life advocating for equality and social justice. abdul jabbar will take another step in his activism walk as an executive producer and narrator of the documentary fight the power the movements that changed america which premieres saturday on the history channel. the one hour documentary explores the history of protests that shaped the course for justice in america. fight the power examines the labor movement of the 1880s women s suffrage and civil rights along with the lgbtq and black lives matter initiatives. it also features footage from abdul jabbar s personal experiences when he covered one of martin luther king news conferences at age 17 and attended the famous 1967 cleveland summit where prominent black athletes such as bill russell and jim brown discussed muhammad ali s refusal to serve in the vietnam war. abdul jabbar said co executive producer deborah morales was adamant about the documentary needing to include all groups impacted by bigotry and discrimination. his pursuit toward social justice for marginalized people prompted the nba to create an award bearing his name last month. in a recent interview abdul jabbar spoke with the associated press about the importance of project his unforgettable conversation with king and how emmett till and james baldwin were catalysts to his social justice journey. ap why does the documentary focus on several different movements . abdul jabbar for me it is trying to show that what black americans must deal with has been experienced by other marginalized groups. all of us at one time or another have been targeted by the dominant group. so we must understand that all of us are in the same boat and we have to stick up for the rights of every marginalized group not just the ones that we re in that causes controversy but to look at other issues. ap when did you first realize people of color were treated unfairly in this country . abdul jabbar it started when i was 8 years old. that s how old i was when emmett till was murdered. and i didn t understand it. i asked my parents to explain it. they didn t have the words. i was like where do i live why am i a target here . abdul jabbar i was in the eighth grade. i was about 13 years old and i read james baldwin s the fire next time. that explained it all to me. it gave me an idea of what i had to do and what black americans had to do in order to get out from underneath all of this oppression. abdul jabbar i never really saw myself as a leader in all of it. i was someone who spoke out. i had enough nerve and was crazy enough to speak out about things. if we don t talk about the issues they don t get dealt with. so somebody has to go out there and speak. you remember all the controversy behind lebron james saying shut up and dribble is a lot of you have to just get to that point where you can say that and have people understand what it means. ap which personal experience highlighted in the doc stands out to you the most . abdul jabbar when i was 17 and i got to interview dr. king. just to exchange some words with him. but to understand what his message actually meant i never really compared it side by side with what malcolm x was talking about. when you do that you find out actually that they

unrest,"home us carries out airstrikes in iraq and syria . washington the united states carried out airstrikes early monday morning in iraq and syria against two iranian backed militias that the pentagon said had conducted drone strikes against american personnel in iraq in recent weeks the defense department said. at president biden s direction military forces earlier this evening conducted defensive precision airstrikes against facilities used by iran backed militia groups in the iraq syria border region the pentagon spokesman john f. kirby said in a statement. mr. kirby said the facilities were used by iranian backed militias including kata ib hezbollah and kata ib sayyid al shuhada to store arms and ammunition for carrying out attacks against places where americans were located in iraq. there were no immediate reports of casualties but a military after action review is ongoing pentagon officials said. the strikes were the second time that mr. biden has ordered the use of force in the region. the united states carried out airstrikes in eastern syria in late february against buildings belonging to what the pentagon said were iran backed militias responsible for attacks against american and allied personnel in iraq. the latest strikes were carried out by air force fighter bombers based in the region. pentagon planners have been gathering information for weeks on the sites and militia networks that use them american officials said on sunday. defense secretary lloyd j. austin iii and gen. mark a. milley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff briefed mr. biden on attack options early last week and mr. biden approved striking the three targets the officials said. the strikes were carried out a little more than a week after iran elected a hard liner ebrahim raisi as its next president. the military action also came as the negotiations intended to bring the united states and tehran back into compliance with an international nuclear accord have reached a crucial juncture. president donald j. trump pulled the united states out of the accord in 2018 and mr. biden has been seeking to revive it. on sunday secretary of state antony j. blinken discussed the negotiations on the nuclear deal with israel s foreign minister yair lapid who said israel had serious reservations about the accord which would ease sanctions on iran in return for limits on its nuclear program. earlier this month the biden administration blocked access to myriad websites linked to iran after the nation held a presidential vote to install mr. raisi a close ally of the clerical government s supreme leader as its top elected official. pressure has been building for weeks from democrats and republican in congress and from some of mr. biden s top advisers and commanders to retaliate against the threat posed by the drones to american diplomats and the 2500 troops in iraq who are training and advising iraqi forces. at least five times since april the iranian backed militias have used small explosive laden drones that divebomb and crash into their targets in late night attacks on iraqi bases including those used by the and special operations units according to american officials. so far no americans have been hurt in the attacks but officials worry about the precision of the drones also called unmanned aerial vehicles or the drones are part of a rapidly evolving threat from iranian proxies in iraq with militia forces specialized in operating more sophisticated weaponry hitting some of the most sensitive american targets in attacks that evaded defenses. iran weakened by years of harsh economic sanctions is using its proxy militias in iraq to step up pressure on the united states and other world powers to negotiate an easing of those sanctions as part of a possible revival of the 2015 nuclear deal. iraqi and american officials say iran has devised the drone attacks to minimize casualties to avoid prompting retaliation. american officials said the strikes against two targets in eastern syria and a third just across the border in iraq were carried out about 1 monday local time by a mix of air force f 16s and f 15es based in the region. the fighter bombers dropped multiple bombs 500 pound and 2000 pound satellite guided munitions on each of the three structures. american officials said the militias used the sites targeted in syria mainly for storage and logistics purposes the site hit in iraq was used to launch and recover the armed drones which officials said were either made in iran or used iranian technology. mr. kirby and other administration officials characterized the strikes as defensive but leading lawmakers demanded more details on sunday. congress must be briefed on these airstrikes without delay said senator tim kaine democrat of virginia who has led the fight to limit presidential war powers for a decade from the senate foreign relations committee. if the strikes were against militias that were using to attack american personnel that would be a conventional self defense action that is justified. michael p. mulroy a former officer and top middle east policy official at the pentagon has warned that with the technology provided by iran s quds force the foreign facing arm of iran s security apparatus the drones are rapidly becoming more sophisticated at a relatively low cost. this action should send a message to iran that it cannot hide behind its proxy forces to attack the united states and our iraqi partners mr. mulroy said on sunday. but mr. biden s top aides have also said they want to avoid the angry rhetorical jabs and tit for tat threats that mr. trump often engaged in with iran and its proxies in iraq and avoid escalating tensions with tehran at a time when the white house is trying to nail down the nuclear deal. the airstrikes in february against the same militias were also a relatively small carefully calibrated military response seven 500 pound bombs dropped on a small cluster of buildings at an unofficial crossing at the syria iraq border used to smuggle across weapons and fighters. those earlier strikes were just over the border in syria to avoid diplomatic blowback to the iraqi government. the same calculus influenced the planning for the strike on monday two of the three targets were in syria along the iraqi border and the third was just inside iraqi territory. the strikes took place early monday in part to avoid any civilian casualties officials said. the united states took necessary appropriate and deliberate action designed to limit the risk of escalation but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message mr. kirby said. how the militias and iran will respond is unclear and american officials said the relatively small set of airstrikes were unlikely to stop the militia attacks completely. after the february strikes there was a lull in militia activity against american locations for several weeks but then an even more dangerous threat emerged the small armed drones.

science,"the curiosity rover is heading for the hills as it continues to explore mars and the proverbial gold it s looking for may surprise you organic salts. jpl caltech msss nasa nasa s curiosity mars rover used two cameras to create this selfie in front of mont mercou a rock outcrop that stands 20 feet 6 meters tall. image credit nasa jpl caltech msss . no that s not for your farm to table cooking. organic salt is a key ingredient in the quest for evidence of life on planets beyond earth. the rover has been exploring gale crater likely the site of an ancient lake since 2012. it began ascending the 3 mile high mount sharp located at the center of the crater in 2014. the mission began with the goals of determining if conditions on mars ever supported life as well as characterizing the martian climate and geology. curiosity has achieved most of what it was designed to do but it s now crossing into an interesting new phase investigating a transition that occurred on mars billions of years ago. evidence observed by robotic missions on mars as well as orbiters circling the red planet have helped scientists determine that it was likely a warmer wetter place about 4 billion years ago. that s until some catalyst caused mars to lose most of its atmosphere and become a frozen desert about 3 billion years ago. now it s moving into a zone where the rocks grow salty filled with sulfate minerals according to abigail fraeman curiosity deputy project scientist at nasa s jet propulsion laboratory. the curiosity mission is managed by staff at the lab which is located in pasadena california. the presence of clay rocks suggests that they formed when water was present on the planet. sulfate minerals indicate that this water was evaporating or growing more acidic. that means curiosity is essentially crossing into a place where this transition from wet to dry occurred on mars so it can directly observe the effects of this ancient climate change. they are much more likely to survive on mars than ancient molecules which would have been much more fragile. curiosity has already found evidence of organic compounds on mars. these could be indicators that ancient microbial life was once present or they could have been formed through natural geologic processes. organic salts can add more heft to the idea that organic matter was once on mars but it also adds to the idea that mars could still be habitable today. on earth organic salts can be used by some forms of life for energy. if we determine that there are organic salts concentrated anywhere on mars we ll want to investigate those regions further and ideally drill deeper below the surface where organic matter could be better preserved said james m. t. lewis an organic geochemist at nasa s goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland in a statement. new research published by lewis and his team in the journal of geophysical research planets in march suggests that these organic salts are on mars curiosity just has to find them. and it s not as easy as it sounds. even if these salts were lying directly on the martian surface they have been there for billions of years. the thin atmosphere on mars means the salts have been subject to harsh radiation over time which can break down organic matter. the researchers have analyzed data from one of curiosity s onboard instruments called sam or the sample analysis at mars. this ovenlike chemistry lab located inside the belly of the rover has indirectly indicated that organic salts are present on mars. what sam ca n t do is provide direct evidence. when the instrument heats up samples of martian soil and rock collected by the rover gases are released that can be used to determine the composition of the samples. these could be related to other components in martian soil. the data curiosity sends back to earth can be used by scientists to piece together the composition of rock and soil fragments on mars creating a larger picture of what the planet was like billions of years ago. we re trying to unravel billions of years of organic chemistry and in that organic record there could be the ultimate prize evidence that life once existed on the red planet lewis said. for example sam helped researchers confirm the presence of organic molecules on mars containing carbon which is essential to life as we understand it. the fact that there s organic matter preserved in 3 billion year old rocks and we found it at the surface is a very promising sign that we might be able to tap more information from better preserved samples below the surface said jennifer l. eigenbrode an astrobiologist at nasa goddard who worked on both the carbon study and the latest research with lewis in a statement. curiosity has an array of instruments stashed on board and now researchers are looking to another one as a helpful tool in the search for salt. the chemistry and mineralogy instrument or chemin has not detected organic salts so far but nasa scientists believe it could if there are enough of them present. both sam and chemin will come into play as curiosity crosses into new territory. the sam oven works by heating samples to 1800 degrees fahrenheit 1000 degrees celsius or higher. these scorching temperatures can break down molecules and releases gases. lewis and his team wanted to model what kinds of gases organic salts may give off if they made it into the sam oven so they ran an experiment on earth that replicated martian rocks. the scientists also simulated samples including perchlorates. these salts which are common on mars include chlorine and oxygen. but scientists worry that if perchlorates are included in samples they could interfere with the search for organic matter given their composition. when heating martian samples there are many interactions that can happen between minerals and organic matter that could make it more difficult to draw conclusions from our experiments so the work we re doing is trying to pick apart those interactions so that scientists doing analyses on mars can use this information lewis said. the team was able to show that chemin could be used to detect organic salts. the instrument aims x rays at martian samples to determine their composition. while the perseverance rover located about 2300 miles 3701 kilometers away does n t have any instruments that can detect organic salts help will be on the way next year. the european space agency s exomars rover launching in 2022 will be able to search for samples below the martian surface because it can drill down feet 2 meters into the soil. it will carry an instrument developed at goddard that can analyze soil chemistry.

stations where they were originally booked to complete the processing for their freedom. zaw zaw head of the yangon region s prison department confirmed that more than 720 people were released from the prison which for decades has been the main facility for political prisoners. according to official announcements on state media most if not all of the freed detainees faced charges related to the protests including section 505 a of myanmar s penal code which makes it a crime to spread comments that create public unrest or fear or spread false news and carries a penalty of up to three years in prison. it appeared however that an unknown number of people held on that charge might still be detained. complete information was not available and the releases are expected to take place over

part in the protests but did not take part in the violence who did not commit crimes and did not lead the riots. the assistance association for political prisoner said tuesday that 5224 people were in detention in connection with the protests. the group keeps detailed tallies of arrests and casualties linked to the nation s political conflicts. the government is eager to cultivate goodwill among the public a large part of which is hostile to it. on tuesday it announced that it was dropping charges against about two dozen celebrities who had taken a role in the protests. it would also like to soften its international image. the general assembly on june 18 passed a resolution calling for an arms embargo against the southeast asian nation and condemning the military s seizure of power. several western nations have already implemented diplomatic and economic sanctions. tun kyi a senior member of the former political prisoners society charged that the detainees were released to reduce pressure from the international community and said they shouldn t have been arrested in the first place. the military abducted dissidents and took them hostage. it is not an unconditional release of all political leaders and prisoners but rather intended to avoid international pressure he said. and there is no reason to be thankful. myanmar is also facing a surge in covid 19 cases with 1312 new

social,from the pages of medical economics . many physicians falsely believe that retirement planning will be easy because they are high income earners. however high income does not guarantee smart money management and even physicians aren t immune to making financial missteps. to ensure financial health physicians should avoid these common retirement planning mistakes. medical school and residency may prevent physicians from entering their earning years until their mid 30s. as such clinicians have less time to accumulate savings and savings have less time in the market to compound. unfortunately for many young residents socking away for retirement tends to take a back seat to purchasing a home starting a family or simply not having to live frugally. in order to counteract getting a late start physicians will need to increase their savings rate and begin funding their retirement savings as soon as possible. because physicians are high earners they usually enjoy a higher standard of living that they would like to maintain in retirement. in order to live a comparable lifestyle over an extended retirement period physicians need to find ways to accelerate their savings. although it is commonly recommended that the average person saves 10 of their income physicians need to save closer to if not higher than 20 . accessing funds before retirement. the purpose of retirement planning is to accumulate adequate resources to fund your life post career without running out of money not to fund short term goals such as buying a house or sending a child to college. sometimes tunnel vision conquers willpower however and people borrow from their 401k fund. not only does this postpone savings goals but it also brings a potential tax burden and penalty fees. even physicians are susceptible to underestimating the escalating cost of health care. the rate of increase of health care costs has long surpassed the average annual increase in americans income. according to a march 2019 study published in the journal of the american medical association health care spending in the united states was trillion or about 11000 per person in 2017. by 2027 these costs are expected to reach 6 trillion or 17000 per person. lacking estate planning documents. physicians like many people may not be vigilant about preparing personal estate planning documents. pertinent documents include your financial powers of attorney medical directives to be used while you are alive and a will to make your wishes known for the disposition of your estate after your death. in the absence of these documents your family could be exposed to making tough medical decisions on your behalf a lengthy probate process and costly attorney fees all of which could be significantly injurious to their financial well being. not working with a financial adviser. saving for retirement is one of the most important and difficult financial decisions people face. with retirement periods extending alongside rising life expectancies the ability to accumulate adequate resources to provide yourself with a financial cushion no matter how long you live is becoming increasingly challenging. a trusted advisor can point you in the right direction not only from a financial perspective but from a personal one. ms andrews is a principal and cofounder of atlanta financial associates. she specializes in working with physicians and executives in the health care industry.

disaster,"the politics of division won t advance progress on a contentious ring of fire road corridor contends the chief of a remote first nation community. neskantaga s wayne moonias is offended by remarks made by indigenous relations and reconciliation minister david zimmer in the ontario legislature after a trip made last month to an exploration camp in the james bay lowlands hosted by noront resources and the chiefs of webequie and marten falls. 14 letter written to northern development and mines minister michael gravelle and obtained by northern ontario business moonias reminds the province that his community still has not consented to a provincial plan to begin construction on an east west road into the far north mineral belt by 2019. we are deeply troubled by the politics of division a politics of side deals and misleading public announcements that ontario is recklessly pursuing moonias wrote. 23 question period in queen s park zimmer spoke about his day trip to noront s fly in esker camp and tour of the company s exploration project 530 kilometres northeast of thunder bay. there zimmer said he met with the ring of fire chiefs and was involved in extensive briefings extensive consultations to find out how to best deal with the transportation corridor issue. zimmer was responding to criticism from sault ste. marie mpp ross romano on the third world conditions in these isolated communities and the government s lack of movement on the road development. describing the chiefs of marten falls and webequie as the ring of fire chiefs sends the wrong signal to the public and investors moonias wrote in his letter to gravelle who accompanied zimmer on the trip along with municipal affairs minister bill mauro. the public and investors could be misled into thinking that the support of only two of the nine matawa communities would be required to deal with the transportation corridor . moonias and neskantaga remain upset over premier kathleen wynne s announcement in thunder bay last august that preparatory engineering and environmental work was beginning toward the construction of two routes into the ring of fire in 2019 a shared east west community industrial road and the first leg of a north south corridor. the roads would link the communities of marten falls nibinamik and webequie to the provincial highway network for the first time. neskantaga and eabametoong remain on the sidelines harbouring concerns over the environmental and social effects that mine related development would have on their communities. but the wynne government is anxious to get activity going in the ring of fire as political and industrial pressure builds heading into the 2018 election. moonias said negotiating with individual communities and not all nine in the matawa tribal council doesn t follow the spirit of the province s ongoing regional framework agreement started more than three years ago to devise the best approach to mine development in the far north. moonias urged the government to return to the negotiating table. a politics of division that pits first nations against each other is a return to colonialism and a rejection of reconciliation he wrote. the truth is that informed consent of all matawa first nations will be required before shovels are in the ground in the ring of fire.

politics,"hong kong ap for years china has quashed any discussion on the mainland of its bloody 1989 crackdown on pro democracy protesters in beijing s tiananmen square nearly erasing what happened from the collective consciousness. hong kong ap for years china has quashed any discussion on the mainland of its bloody 1989 crackdown on pro democracy protesters in beijing s tiananmen square nearly erasing what happened from the collective consciousness. now it may be hong kong s turn as china s ruling communist party pulls the city more directly into its orbit. the semi autonomous territories of hong kong and nearby macao were for years the last places on chinese soil allowed to publicly mark the events of june 4 1989 when the people s liberation army opened fire on student led protesters in a crackdown that left hundreds if not thousands dead. before last year tens of thousands gathered annually in hong kong s victoria park lighting candles and singing songs to remember the victims. but authorities citing the coronavirus pandemic are banning that vigil for the second straight year. and a museum dedicated to the event suddenly closed wednesday just two days before friday s anniversary after authorities investigated it for lacking the necessary licenses to hold a public exhibition. hong kong s security minister warned residents last week against taking part in unauthorized assemblies. in mainland china younger generations have grown up with little knowledge of or debate about the crackdown but the efforts to suppress commemorations in hong kong reflect another turn of the screw in beijing s ever tightening control over hong kong following massive anti government protests in 2019. those demonstrations evolved into months of sometimes violent clashes between smaller groups of protesters and police. and they have led to a broader crackdown on dissent in the former british colony which was long an oasis of capitalism and democracy and was promised that it would largely maintain its freedoms for 50 years when it was returned to china in 1997. since the protests china has imposed a sweeping national security law aimed in part at stiffening the penalties for the actions that protesters engaged in and authorities have sought to arrest nearly all of the city s outspoken and prominent pro democracy figures. most are either behind bars or have fled the city. despite the restrictions this year there are calls for hongkongers to remember the 1989 crackdown in private with vigil organizers calling on residents to light a candle at 8 online calls circulating on social media also urged residents to dress in black on friday. local newspaper ming pao last week published an article suggesting that residents write the numbers six and four on their light switches a nod to the june 4 date so each flip of the switch is also an act of remembrance. for decades chan kin wing has regularly attended the vigil in hong kong. i was lucky to have been born in hong kong. if i had been born on the mainland i could have been one of the students in tiananmen square that day said chan whose parents had fled to hong kong from the mainland in the 1960s. when june 4 1989 happened all of hong kong witnessed the indelible historical event of students massacred by a corrupt regime chan said. this year chan plans to remember the event privately dressing in black and changing his profile picture on social media to an image of a lit candle in the dark. i ve resolved to never forget about june 4 and strive to pass on memories of it to ensure it s never forgotten he said. in mainland china the group tiananmen mothers that represents victims relatives published an appeal on the human rights in china website urging the party to heed their long held demands for a complete release of official records about the crackdown compensation for those killed and injured and for those responsible to be held to account. we look forward to the day when the cpc and the chinese government can sincerely and courageously set the record straight and take up their due responsibility for the anti human 1989 massacre in accordance with the law and the facts the statement said. while tiananmen mothers said 62 of its members have died since the group was founded in the late 1990s many young chinese it said have grown up in a false sense of prosperous jubilance and enforced glorification of the government and have no idea of or refuse to believe what happened on june 4 1989 in the nation s capital. the government however seems intent on running out the clock on such appeals. while tiananmen mothers said 62 of its members have died since the group was founded in the late 1990s many young chinese it said have grown up in a false sense of prosperous jubilance and enforced glorification of the government and have no idea of or refuse to believe what happened on june 4 1989 in the nation s capital. in hong kong the recent arrests and convictions of prominent activists have had a chilling effect on those who participated in the vigil in the past said chow hang tung the vice chair of the hong kong alliance in support of patriotic democratic movements of china which operates the june 4 museum. there will obviously be fear and people cannot just assume that they can come and express their remembrance for the tiananmen massacre victims and be unscathed she said. chow said that what keeps her going is the dream that china and hong kong can both have democracy one day. the tide though appears to be going in the other direction. this is something worth fighting for she said. if one day we cannot talk about tiananmen that would signify that hong kong is totally assimilated into chinese society.

arts,"cleveland ohio cleveland metroparks called it a wrap thursday on a decade long quest to add a new bike and pedestrian connection to lake erie at wendy park on whiskey island. some 500 onlookers showed up on a flawless june morning to witness a ribbon cutting signaling completion of the 6 million wendy park bridge which spans the norfolk southern rail lines that divide whiskey island the colorful misnomer for the peninsula west of the mouth of the cuyahoga river. it was an absolutely huge crowd brian zimmerman ceo of metroparks said after the event. it was pretty humbling to see how many people showed up. the bridge was full of people before we dedicated it. hundreds of cyclists came through walkers came through joggers were literally running through. asked how it felt to see the public response to the bridge s completion zimmerman said i don t know if i could feel any better. cleveland metroparks acquired the 22 acre park and an eight acre marina on the peninsula in 2014 from cuyahoga county. the park occupies the northern portion of the peninsula which is separated by the rail lines from properties on the south side owned by ontario stone a crushed stone supplier and cargill deicing technology which operates a salt mine beneath lake erie. the county bought the property in 2004 from cleveland businessman dan t. moore iii who led a partnership that bought the acreage in 1993 from conrail which is now a subsidiary of csx and norfolk southern. starting in the late 1980s moore s ambition was to turn the marina into a successful business venture while keeping the adjacent 22 acres open as a publicly accessible park. the marina failed to attract enough boaters to make it a financial success but moore succeeded in demonstrating the demand for a new lakefront park on the city s west side. now a cleveland metroparks commissioner moore donated 3 million through a private foundation to complete the new 6 million bridge. the bridge and the park are named in memory of dan and his wife marge moore s daughter artist wendy moore who died in 1997 from complications after suffering a head injury in a skiing accident. thursday s event also celebrated the completion of the million whiskey island connector a mile off road trail connecting wendy park to edgewater park located to the west. wendy park is one of five units in the 470 acre metroparks lakefront reservation. the agency leases four of the five units including edgewater from the city of cleveland. the wendy park bridge eliminates a mile detour that had been required to reach wendy park from the south. bicyclists and pedestrians can reach the new bridge from the south via a walkway on the willow avenue lift bridge and the cleveland foundation centennial lake link trail on the west bank of the flats. about miles south of whiskey island the lake link trail intersects with the 101 mile towpath trail reaching deep into northern ohio. the wendy park bridge addresses a large regional audience eager to gain better access to lake erie. but it also provides a link for residents of the immediate area in ohio city on cleveland s west side including residents of the cuyahoga metropolitan housing authority s lakeview estates complex which overlooks the old channel of the cuyahoga river just south of whiskey island. the new bridge is part of the million tiger projects undertaken by metroparks to provide safe seamless car free connectivity to parks and waterfronts on the city s west side by eliminating gaps such as the one caused by the railroad tracks on whiskey island. the projects take their name from an obama era program called transportation investments generating economic recovery. other tiger investments include the recently completed red line greenway and trail segments linking cleveland lakefront bikeway to the lake link trail and the lake link trail to canal basin park on the columbus road peninsula.

religion,"latta plantation refused to apologize saturday for a controversial program whose racist juneteenth event description promised to tell the story of white refugees and defeated confederate soldiers. in a lengthy post on the website of the living history museum near charlotte site manager ian campbell who noted that he is black called out charlotte mayor vi lyles and other critics of the event. the program was abruptly canceled friday following the backlash to the event and its promotion. at issue was the plantation s online and social media promotion for the 25 event called kingdom coming which was set to take place next saturday on juneteenth. the holiday commemorates the emancipation of slaves in the united states. but the description did n t acknowledge the significance of june 19th. it was sympathetic to those who owned slaves in the wake of emancipation and inaccurately minimized an unnamed slaveowner to an overseer and referred to him as massa. the observer previously reported. the post also referred to freedmen but did not include that black people were enslaved in the united states for nearly 250 years. instead the museum s site referred to slaves as former bondsmen. campbell said he created the kingdom coming event and took full responsibility for it. he said the confederacy white supremacy overseers plantation owners and white refugees will never be glorified. to the masses on social media and politicians no apology will be given for bringing a unique program to educate the public about former slaves becoming free my job will be to continue to educate campbell said. historic latta plantation s narrative will be to give a voice to our ancestors enslaved and as freedmen who were denied a voice. we will speak for them in a compassionate accurate and sensitive manner. the event s description started with lines from sweet chariot a mournful slave spiritual some scholars say is aligned with the underground railroad. the plantation s description said attendees would hear from a slaveowner who had been chased out of his house by yankees and his former slaves who were now living high on the hog a reference to better cuts of meat which white slaveowners deprived black people from having. white refugees have been displaced and have a story to tell as well it read. confederate soldiers who will be heading home express their feelings about the downfall of the confederacy. the post ultimately was taken down friday following the criticism. a non profit corporation operates historic latta plantation while mecklenburg county owns the land and mecklenburg county park and recreation maintains the property. latta place inc. is the nonprofit whose mission is to preserve the historic plantation site. according to its 2018 tax return the most recent one available online it had total revenue of 328276 and total expenses of 422928. on its website the plantation describes itself as a circa 1800 living history museum and farm. throughout the year historic latta plantation offers educational and school programs featuring animals workshops camps and plantation house along with a carriage barn cabins and outbuildings give visitors a glimpse into 19th century life in the carolina backcountry. after the event was posted on the plantation s facebook page a number of commenters criticized the plantation calling the juneteenth event absolutely disgusting and unbelievable. in a statement friday afternoon mecklenburg county government said it has zero tolerance for programs that do not embrace equity and diversity. because of the kingdom coming event the county said it is looking at its contract with the facility vendor regarding future programming. mayor lyles tweeted friday we should not support any business or organization that does not respect equality history and the truth of the african american people s journey to freedom. despite intent words matter lyles said. and the historic latta plantation should know better. juneteenth she said should be celebrated and honored in the most humble way possible with laser focus on the perspective of the inhumane treatment of an enslaved people. and the town of huntersville tweeted that it was withholding its annual contribution to the center pending further investigations into the facts surrounding this program. that requested contribution is 20000 town commissioner stacy phillips tweeted. on saturday the arts science council also criticized the plantation event. it is frustrating and upsetting that historic latta plantation continues to tell and share the site s history in ways that centers and protects the feelings of white people while diminishing the stories and contributions of black people the asc tweeted. this is white supremacy and one of the reasons we stopped providing operating support funding to historic latta plantation in 2016. in his statement campbell said it was only after the social media frenzy that latta received numerous emails and phone calls about the event which was canceled over security concerns for staff and volunteers. but he wrote that for as long as he has been with the plantation i have never seen vi lyles the mayor of the great city of charlotte visit our site or any other influential and prominent government officials. the same applies to npr wbtv the charlotte observer et al. campbell wrote that many people had complained about historic latta not doing anything for juneteenth. then when i create a unique event to highlight our successful struggle out of slavery there is backlash from many who have never visited our historical site he stated. union general william t. sherman had a dislike for the media of his day. i understand what he may have been going through.

engagement comments. but if i share photos of me in a bikini talking about exercise healthy eating working out in the gym the content is liked by less people and in fact i get more negative comments
