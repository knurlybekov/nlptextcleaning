labour,is it good for our health and longevity to heave dig hoist stroll or otherwise exert ourselves during working hours or are strenuous occupations hard on our bodies and health common sense might tell us that being in motion at work should be beneficial for our hearts and health just as going for a jog or bike ride or working out at the gym is good for us but some recent research has suggested that manual labor often increases workers risks for cardiovascular disease and premature death meaning the effects of work related physical activity might be different and less salubrious than those of the workouts we choose to do on our own time now though the newest and largest study to date of occupational physical activity and mortality has some good news for those with physically demanding jobs the new study which involved almost half a million workers finds that people whose jobs involve frequent moving and lifting tend to live longer than those whose occupations are deskbound the results refute the idea that worktime exertions somehow are different than other exercise and instead suggest that whenever possible we should be on the move while on the job no one disputes that exercise is beneficial and in general the more the better but exercise is volitional we can decide for the most part whether when where how long how hard and with whom we will work out it has not been altogether clear whether mandatory physical activity affects our bodies in the same ways as workouts we choose for ourselves when mice or rats run on treadmills where the pace intensity duration and mere existence of the workouts are set for them they typically produce stress hormones and often wind up with different biological outcomes than if they skitter through the same mileage on running wheels something rodents voluntarily seem to love to do in an interesting study rats running on treadmills developed higher levels of anxiety than rats running on wheels and showed different effects on the production of new neurons in their brains familiar with this area of research some exercise scientists started to wonder a few years ago if workplace physical activity which can be compulsory might likewise produce different and potentially less desirable physiological effects on people than leisure time exercise to find out they checked survey data about occupational physical activity against death registries and they uncovered sobering associations according to a analysis of more than a dozen relevant studies men whose jobs demanded frequent lifting carrying and other tiring physical labor were percent more likely to die prematurely than men whose jobs were less physically demanding the studies found no associations between women s occupational activities and longevity the review s authors and other scientists called their findings a physical activity paradox in which having to move at work seemed to undermine men s health and life spans while choosing to exercise during off hours improved them but some exercise researchers remained skeptical these scientists suspected that any relationship between hard labor and early death might be due more to people s lives away from the job than to their exertions at work and that past research had not controlled adequately for lifestyle so for the new study which was published in april in the lancet public health researchers at the norwegian school of sport sciences in oslo and other institutions decided to delve as deeply and broadly as possible into lifestyle as well as workplace labor and life spans they began by turning to data already gathered by norwegian health agencies which as part of ongoing studies have been measuring the health of hundreds of thousands of norwegians for decades that data included detailed information about their work and exercise histories education income and other aspects of their lives the researchers now pulled records for of the participants in these studies and categorized them by job types some like clerks or inspectors did some walking and lifting at work others performed heavy manual labor and the rest more or less sat at their desks all day the researchers then crosschecked people s records against decades worth of databases tracking diseases and deaths in norway on a first pass their results bolstered the idea that active jobs shorten lives over the course of about years men in sedentary jobs outlived those who often walked or otherwise exerted themselves at work as before there were no significant links between women s professions and their longevity but when the scientists scrupulously controlled for everyone s education income smoking exercise habits and weight the associations flipped in this fuller analysis men who were active at work developed heart disease and cancer at lower rates than deskbound men whether they tended to walk a fair amount for work or perform other more strenuous labor the active men lived on average about a year longer in essence the study shows that every movement counts regardless of whether you are active at work or during leisure says ulf ekelund a professor at the norwegian school of sport sciences who oversaw the new study conversely the results also remind us he says that sitting even at comfortable desks or on cushy couches is unhealthy what this study does not tell us is which aspects of our lives away from work might most affect our health and longevity or why women s life spans seem generally unaffected by worktime exertions dr ekelund and his colleagues hope to look into some of those issues in future research but for now he says assume that all physical activity is beneficial regardless of whether it s performed during leisure at work at home or during transportation,good health longevity heave dig hoist stroll otherwise exert working strenuous hard health common sense might tell motion work beneficial heart health going jog bike ride working gym

labour,akinse at atrenta or fifteen thirty perhaps the most awaited date on the calendar for most employees and one of the most dreaded dates for the employers while the country is still crippled by the percent unemployment rate because of the coronavirus disease covid pandemic as reported by the philippines statistics authority and employers are finding ways to minimize operational cost it is still surprising to hear stories of small and medium enterprise owners trying to keep their workforce intact and meeting the fifteen thirty deadline for their payroll as owners of small businesses perhaps you are often tempted to delay your employees salaries or worse lay them off but there are more benefits to paying your employees on time than skipping payments just to save a few pesos you are not just feeding one person but a whole family is what i often hear from my clients who are seeking financing to bridge their payroll and i could not help but agree most employees rely on their stable paycheck to sustain their families a delayed paycheck could mean a disconnected electricity bill a missed hospital bill or even a skipped meal if you pay your employees regularly you contribute to your employees sense of financial security and mental stability this in turn results in higher productivity as your employees will have less time to think about their obligations and focus only on work as they put it happy employees happy workplace a stable paycheck is also directly related to employee retention and overall workplace satisfaction by paying your employees on time you assure them that their contributions are rewarded and that you have an intention to work with them for a longer time who would want to stay with an employer who often misses their payment but demands for more output right not to mention that hiring new employees due to high turnover costs more than keeping them as this would mean additional costs for training screening and lost productivity lastly paying your employees on time reflects the kind of values you uphold as an employer while the goal of every business is to gain more profit it is also important to make your employees feel valued this is equal to saying that you do not only treat your employees as moneymaking machines but your business s main driver of success it boosts your employees morale and makes them feel that your business goals are aligned with theirs now as an employer how do you make sure that you will not miss your employees payroll oftentimes employers miss their payroll because of unexpected payment to suppliers or delayed collections from buyers thus it is important to be familiar with your company s monthly cash flow and keep track of your expenses while making sure that you have enough funds to cover the upcoming payroll delayed collections are inevitable in every business but this should not be an excuse to delay your employees salaries as well organize and understand your cut off and payment schedule know how long it usually takes to process document submissions fund releases and even banking hours you would not want to lose a valuable employee just because you missed the timing get access to bridge or short term financing as filipino business owners we often go to our relatives or friends who can lend us some money with a promise to pay after a month or two whenever we are short of cash it is a quick and easy solution but not always available especially if you need a bigger amount than usual this calls the need for a financing partner who can offer short term loans to bridge cash flow gaps short term financing allows you to get quick access to funds to cover your payroll and unexpected expenses while waiting for your receivables to be collected the good thing about this is that you will not be tied to long term debt which can even affect your cash flow in the long run while this puts a heavier accountability on the employer s side especially in this pandemic we must understand that putting up a business entails the labor cost it is not something that can be removed from the equation for a small business owner managing the payroll alone can be a stressful task but a wise business owner should know that paying them on time should be your responsibility and priority after all they are your business most valuable asset pinkle evangelio is one of the newest

humaninterest,friday june sometimes the devil really is in the details this is especially true when it comes to the questions you ask when you re looking for a job and it can be tricky to know when to ask there are a few good rules of thumb to follow the first applies to networking when you re meeting someone new they want to get to know you first they in theory have no specific ulterior motive and hope you don t either when you first meet someone avoid asking if they re hiring chances are good they re not hiring and if you ask this up front you might send the message that you re not interested in getting to know them unless they can give you something do ask them if you can stay in touch ask to connect on linkedin ask to have coffee virtual or in person relationship building might eventually lead you down the path of a new job another situation happens when you find a job posted perhaps the perfect job at the perfect company and you ve either found a great connection there or already have one when reaching out about a specific job be up front about it a hiring manager will want to know that you d like to be considered so be sure to ask ask them if they have time to meet with you to discuss the position don t hint around and hope they ll get the drift be direct the most important place for questions is the job interview it s truly amazing how much your questions can influence the outcome of an interview first have questions lots of them having a long list of questions doesn t mean you have to ask all of them but it does mean you ll have options to go to when it s your turn to ask questions one of the primary complaints i ve heard from hiring managers is that the candidate didn t ask questions the hiring manager assumes the candidate isn t interested in the position or worse is lazy while the candidate simply feels all their questions were answered during the job interview avoid this situation by asking a few questions at the end but keep your questions focused on the job do not ask questions that reflect an all about me attitude topics to stay away from include pay vacation time or anything else that isn t specific to the work itself and always ask about the company s timeline and their expected next steps first impressions are as important as qualifications are the questions you ask will influence a hiring manager s decision fortunately there s

sometimes the devil really is in the details this is especially true when it comes to the questions you ask when you re looking for a job asking the wrong question or not asking the right question can get you into trouble when you least expect it and it can be tricky to know when to ask there are a few good rules of thumb to follow the first applies to networking when you re meeting someone new they want to get to know you first they in theory have no specific ulterior motive and hope you don t either when you first meet someone avoid asking if they re hiring chances are good they re not hiring and if you ask this up front you might send the message that you re not interested in getting to know them unless they can give you something do ask them if you can stay in touch ask to connect on linkedin ask to have coffee virtual or in person relationship building might eventually lead you down the path of a new job another situation happens when you find a job posted perhaps the perfect job at the perfect company and you ve either found a great connection there or already have one when reaching out about a specific job be up front about it a hiring manager will want to know that you d like to be considered so be sure to ask ask them if they have time to meet with you to discuss the position don t hint around and hope they ll get the drift be direct the most important place for questions is the job interview it s truly amazing how much your questions can influence the outcome of an interview first have questions lots of them having a long list of questions doesn t mean you have to ask all of them but it does mean you ll have options to go to when it s your turn to ask questions one of the primary complaints i ve heard from hiring managers is that the candidate didn t ask questions the hiring manager assumes the candidate isn t interested in the position or worse is lazy while the candidate simply feels all their questions were answered during the job interview avoid this situation by asking a few questions at the end but keep your questions focused on the job do not ask questions that reflect an all about me attitude topics to stay away from include pay vacation time or anything else that isn t specific to the work itself and always ask about the company s timeline and their expected next steps first impressions are as important as qualifications are

environmental,unfortunately is marking world environment day amid multiple environmental crises impacting its seas waters forests air and agricultural lands especially the mucilage invading the marmara sea has recently become one of the grave environmental concerns threatening life underwater and above the sea according to experts the discharge of industrial and domestic wastes into the sea the dumping of billions of tons of excavation soil into the sea and the failure to take timely measures led to the mucilage invasion in the marmara sea they also warn that it can further spread to the black sea and the aegean in case no efficient action is taken the environment and urbanization ministry announced that an urgent workshop would be organized this weekend to create an action map to fight the mucilage problem just around a month after the first reports about the invasion were revealed turkey s forests and natural beauties are also under threat of mining quarrying and power plants for those who don t know the turkish parliament has a panel especially established to inquire about the impacts of global warming at a meeting last week officials from the tema a foundation for reforestation and the protection of natural habitats as well as combating erosion have outlined how serious the problem was they reported that mining licenses were issued in and for the areas covering the forest area and as a result hectares of forest cover was lost desertification is the biggest environmental problem of turkey they stressed citing the irreversible destruction of the country s natural habitat at the hands of insatiable capitalist drives tema president deniz ata listed three main reasons because of which environmental degradation cannot be prevented inability to produce necessary policies deficiencies regarding legal acquis and lack of proper implementation the fact that turkish politics do not put environmental issues at the center of political priorities has caused those reasons to become structural however there is bad news for those politicians one of the important consequences of the pandemic was that people started to see better the relationship between health and the environment and the importance of preserving nature urban and rural classes are increasingly expressing their discomfort about the disruption of nature due to aggressive economic and industrial activities and are demanding a cleaner nature and environmentally friendly country almost all scientists warn that turkey will be among the countries most affected by global warming in the coming decades increasing drought decrease in clean water resources and shrinkage of agricultural lands are among the effects already seen turkey has not yet ratified the paris climate convention for well known reasons it rejects to be listed among the developed nations as this status brings financial and political burdens but it s also known that the paris convention has decreased the burden falling on the shoulders of individual nations and that turkey s ratification will not bring additional cost in a recent statement environment and urbanization minister mehmet kurum admitted that turkey was not a party to the convention but was still fulfilling its responsibility in the global fight against climate change the point is that the fight for a better and greener world requires global cooperation as unilateral efforts may fail with only a few months to go for the global climate summit it s time for turkey to reconsider its position vis vis the convention consequently turkey should also be aware that its failure to accommodate the european union s green deal will result in great economic losses and trade disadvantages at the same time the eu s green deal could bring opportunities if turkey moves fast for a full green transformation of its economy and industry of course a mental transformation is required in order to do all this it should be understood that the economy can grow by protecting and enriching the environment not by destroying it this may require larger investments in renewable resources but we only have one world and one country to live in turkey with its entire people politics and civil society should launch a green revolution before it gets too late,unfortunately marking world environment day amid multiple environmental crisis air

lifestyle,there s no denying that weddings are joyful but they also come freighted with a list of unwritten rules which guests should obey but often breach of course during the pandemic weddings and other significant life events from civil partnerships to funerals baptisms barmitzvahs and batmitzvahs have been governed by another tougher but necessary set of guidelines downsized guest numbers hand sanitisation after exchanging rings fathers walking their daughters down the aisle metre apart the good news is that last monday june in england many of these rules were relaxed the advice that only people could attend an event has been be lifted the final headcount now depends on how many people the venue can safely accommodate meanwhile weddings wakes and other gatherings can be held in gardens barns and on private land hen and stag parties can also take place however with the delta variant of the virus still spreading in the uk there are a few additional rules to ensure everybody is kept safe these range from increased air ventilation for marquees to conducting a risk assessment don t worry guests this won t be your responsibility all the usual advice on social distancing and hygiene such as hand washing remains the same getting together with loved ones is something many of us have craved over the past months whether you re celebrating as a happy couple ties the knot or saying goodbye to a dear old friend here s how to do it in the safest manner possible can brides and grooms still have the big wedding that they d always planned yes but only if their venue can safely accommodate the guests the person cap on weddings and civil partnerships was lifted on june but venues will still need to do some maths calculating how many people their space can hold in accordance with social distancing measures this also applies to funerals and wakes if the event is being staged in a covid secure venue such as a hotel restaurant church mosque temple or synagogue then this venue should already be taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus the event s organisers should contact the venue manager beforehand to see how many guests can safely attend do i need to wear my face mask if i m a guest at a wedding the rules apply just as if you re travelling on a train or shopping in a supermarket your face covering should be worn during both the ceremony and reception except when you re eating and drinking the only people exempt are the newlyweds the person officiating at the service and those with medical conditions if you re attending an outdoor wedding there s no legal requirement to wear a mask but you may wish to do so for your own safety what happens if i m attending a wedding or wake somewhere that isn t covid secure such as a private home if a wedding or wake is being held inside a private home or another enclosed space then the guestlist will be limited to either six people or two households however if it s a deathbed wedding ceremony where one partner is terminally ill this can be increased to people do outdoor weddings or wakes need to adhere to these rules too if a wedding or wake is taking place in the garden of a private home a field beach or any other outdoor space there s no cap on guest numbers however if more than people are attending a risk assessment see below will need to be carried out social distancing measures for outside space will still apply the popularity of marquees at weddings throws up a conundrum are they indoor or outdoor venues it all comes down to the walls of the marquee if two sides of the canvas are removed or rolled up the increased ventilation this brings means that a marquee based reception will count as being outdoors the words risk assessment were mentioned what does this involve and how onerous is it if the event takes place somewhere used for commercial or hospitality purposes such as a hotel or restaurant then the venue itself should have carried out a risk assessment beforehand however if the ceremony and reception are being hosted somewhere that isn t covid secure such as a private garden or barn then the organiser should carry out the risk assessment themselves it s a simple evaluation that starts with the organiser noting down any risks on a document for example do you have any vulnerable guests the next step is to identify and implement the best actions to minimise the risk of transmission between guests such as establishing more routes to the bathroom increasing ventilation in the venue or installing more hand sanitisation areas if the wedding involves outside suppliers such as caterers they ll also need to complete a risk assessment and share it with the organiser failure to conduct a risk assessment could result in a fine dancefloors will remain closed but brides and grooms will be able to have their first dance photograph roberto westbrook getty images tetra images rf there are few things i love more at a wedding than a good old boogie can i still showcase my moves sadly dancing isn t advised because of the increased risk of transmission dancefloors will remain closed with many venues likely to repurpose them for additional seating space there is of course one exception brides and grooms will be able to have their first dance together meaning they can shimmy samba jitterbug or foxtrot away to their hearts content my friends have booked a band for their wedding will it still be able to perform yes but any bands or choirs must be limited to six members indoors meanwhile because singing increases the risk of airborne transmission of covid through aerosol particles and small droplets guests are advised not to join in singing with bands or choirs how are other nuptial traditions affected by the new guidance wedding speeches should either be conducted outside or by using a pa system so that the speaker doesn t need to shout or project their voice cutting the cake and playing games can still take place but guests will need to exercise the same precautions as they would in any public place such as wearing face coverings guest books photo booths shared orders of service and games are permitted however because a number of people are likely to end up touching these objects their usage should be minimised and hand sanitisation encouraged as for wedding meals it s table service only with no buffets allowed the uk alliance of wedding planners has suggested some covid safe ideas for weddings such as traditional games quiz nights stand up comics and outdoor sports what about hen or stag dos these can still take place however if taking place indoors the numbers attending these prenuptial shindigs are capped at six people or two households outdoors no more than merrymakers can attend do the wedding rules apply to other events the numbers attending funerals and other commemorative events such as stone settings and ash scatterings are no longer curbed at people however cash charity donations are discouraged online platforms such as justgiving are a better idea what happens if i don t obey the rules above if you arrange a gathering but ignore these latest rules you could face a fine if a couple fails to do proper risk assessment on their ceremony then they could be hit with this penalty,joyful also come list unwritten obey often breach course pandemic significant life civil another

health,imagine last night you developed a little runny nose and a sore throat when you woke up this morning you started coughing and had a fever in the past year your mind would have immediately jumped to covid but if you are already fully vaccinated you might wonder should i still get tested for covid as an infectious disease physician i am often asked this question if you have symptoms of covid you should get tested for covid even if you are fully vaccinated you won t be at high risk for hospitalization or severe disease but if you are infected you may pass the virus to an unvaccinated person who could then get very sick vaccines work but aren t effective the high efficacy of these vaccines in the closely controlled environment of clinical trials matches their effectiveness in real life the mrna vaccines made by pfizer and moderna remain over effective in preventing hospitalization or death that does not however mean that you have the same degree of protection from getting infected the latest research estimates that the mrna vaccines offer to protection from getting infected at all it s impossible to know whether a person is fully protected or could still develop a mild case if exposed to the coronavirus if you did happen to get infected you could still spread the virus and that s why testing is still important what is a breakthrough case breakthrough cases demonstrate a basic principle of infectious disease whether or not a person gets infected depends on the balance between two factors intensity of exposure and immune competence intensity of exposure relates to how close an uninfected person is to a highly infectious individual spewing virus while talking and how long the two people are in contact immune competence relates to the body s inherent protection against covid unvaccinated individuals who ve never been infected with the coronavirus have no protection this is a completely new virus after all while fully vaccinated people will be much more protected according to the cdc as of april there had been a total of known sars cov vaccine breakthrough infections in states and territories these are usually asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic cases and most don t result in hospitalization breakthrough cases will continue to occur and though these people are less likely to spread the coronavirus to others than are unvaccinated individuals they still probably can and what about the sars cov variants well the world has been fortunate that the mrna vaccines in particular afford significant protection against all major variants that have emerged so far but it is entirely possible that at some point a coronavirus strain could mutate and partially or fully escape the protection from vaccines this is yet another good reason to get tested if you are feeling sick as vaccination rates rise and daily case counts fall in the and other countries it is also important to keep a close eye on the coronavirus covid testing allows officials to keep track of how much virus is in a community and positive test results can help people quarantine before unknowingly spreading the virus to others so yes please get tested if you have concerning symptoms even if you are fully,imagine last night little runny nose sore throat woke morning fever past year mind would immediately covid already fully might wonder still get tested covid infectious disease physician often question covid get tested covid even fully high risk hospitalization severe disease infected may pas virus unvaccinated person could get sick work effective high efficacy closely environment clinical effectiveness real life made remain effective hospitalization death however mean degree protection getting infected latest research offer protection getting infected impossible know whether person fully could still develop mild case exposed happen get infected could still spread virus testing still important breakthrough case breakthrough demonstrate basic principle infectious disease whether person infected balance two intensity exposure immune competence intensity exposure close uninfected person highly infectious individual spewing virus talking long two people contact immune competence body inherent protection covid unvaccinated never infected protection completely new virus fully people much according april total known vaccine breakthrough usually asymptomatic mildly symptomatic result hospitalization breakthrough continue occur though people less likely spread unvaccinated still probably well world fortunate particular afford significant protection major far entirely possible point strain could mutate partially fully escape protection yet another good reason get tested feeling sick vaccination rise daily case fall also important keep close eye covid testing keep track much virus community positive test help people quarantine unknowingly spreading virus yes please get tested concerning even fully

other,the recent surge in virus cases in indonesia was not unexpected despite a government ban official figures show that at least million people mostly from jakarta had travelled to their home towns to celebrate the hari raya aidilfitri holidays last month in an annual exodus known locally as mudik the government went all out to remind us to stay at home not to mudik but we still went ahead this is the consequence coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investment luhut pandjaitan said at a virtual conference recently indonesia remains the worst hit country in south east asia by far with million cases including more than deaths huge clusters have emerged in a number of regencies in java with new variants including the virulent delta variant first detected in india showing up yesterday the health authorities reported new cases the highest daily rise since february led by jakarta with cases west java with cases and central java with cases jakarta governor anies baswedan has warned that the capital city of million which is the epicentre of the outbreak will enter a critical phase if the situation goes out of control epidemiologist dicky budiman from australia s griffith university told the straits times that the situation is likely as bad if not worse outside jakarta but is hard to measure due to poor data we start with very poor data and poor understanding of the current situation seeing this as a jakarta problem is very wrong and dangerous there are growing calls for a lockdown to curb the spread of the virus as hospital bed occupancy in jakarta shot up to per cent from per cent last week dr dicky said there is a big probability that indonesia may face a similar situation as in india in terms of a rise in the number of cases and deaths lockdown should be one of our weapons or a hammer to contain the delta variant he added the world health organisation stated in its report on thursday with increased transmission due to variants of concern urgent action is needed to contain the situation in many provinces the world bank s indonesia economic prospects report released on the same day made similar recommendations besides accelerating a vaccine roll out indonesia should improve testing tracing and isolating of cases as well as impose adequate mobility curbs it noted that indonesia s free vaccine roll out has begun to lag behind some of its group of peers despite an earlier and stronger start the pandemic risks still loom large with cases increasing significantly in june indonesia remains vulnerable to new waves driven by more transmissible strains as experienced by other countries as well as potentially higher mobility and viral transmission during festivities the vaccination drive which started strongly in january has been languishing due to logistical issues and mismanagement said mr achmad sukarsono associate director and lead analyst for indonesia at control risks there is no light at the end of the tunnel just yet he said in a june outlook report with delays in distribution and cases of vaccine theft by officials placing too much hope on the vaccination drive will lead to disappointment but the government has never been keen on nationwide lockdowns due to fears of economic repercussions a localised lockdown is an option said mr achmad vaccination it appears remains a silver bullet solution with the government planning to ramp up the daily inoculation rate to one million doses a day president joko widodo has ordered jakarta to vaccinate people a day to reach herd immunity by august he admitted that it is an ambitious target but we have no other options but to do it professor hasbullah thabrany public health expert and chief of the indonesian health economic association said while there is no room for complacency the infection figures must be taken in perspective as indonesia has a population of million people in terms of percentage cases in indonesia is far smaller than in malaysia or

world to come and join us help us on that journey work with us learn from us allow us to learn from you and ultimately build a strong relationship he said there were no high level speakers from israel at the event though that may be a result of israel s political uncertainty the list of speakers had also changed quite significantly to exclude several of the original speakers listed on the agenda before the recent conflict last month the united arab emirates issued a rare public rebuke of israel for heavy handed police measures in jerusalem and violent scenes captured by palestinians of israeli security forces storming the al aqsa mosque compound a site sacred to both muslims and jews the violence which erupted in the final days of the muslim holy month of ramadan angered citizens

education,universities have been promising to fix the sector s gender problem for decades but women are still under represented at almost every level particularly in decision making roles among full professors and senior faculty positions and in the highest earning echelons the globe and mail collected and analyzed public sector salary records in ontario going back to to better understand this lack of progress ontario is the only jurisdiction that makes this historical data available in total of ontario s universities were part of the review affiliated colleges were not included only universities that had at least employees on the list as of could be included otherwise small staff fluctuations caused dramatic swings in the findings in order to ensure a fair comparison between the years the globe adjusted for inflation during salary related analysis when ontario passed the sunshine law in the s it determined that only employees who earned would be subject to disclosure that number hasn t changed but if it had moved with inflation the new threshold would be in in calculating data points such as overall representation the globe only captured employees who would qualify for disclosure if the threshold had kept pace with inflation if this had not been done the situation would look much worse because women are concentrated in lower paying jobs for transparency s sake the globe has provided both the inflation adjusted and non adjusted numbers in the overall representation and wage gap charts many assistant and associate professors currently earn below in and could not have been included otherwise it is likely many at the lowest teaching levels did not meet the disclosure threshold in in fact there were so few assistant and associate professors in we did not include them in the analysis to gain a more complete picture of where the imbalances are the globe assessed job titles in administrative leadership and academic roles president provost vice president vice provost associate vice president assistant vice president dean professor professor with additional responsibilities associate professor associate professor with additional responsibilities and assistant professor provosts are often also vice presidents but because of their importance within the executive structure the globe analyzed them separately when assessing professors and associate professors the globe took into account faculty members who were also listed as having additional duties such as department head assistant dean or research chair this is what additional responsibilities means read more about the globe s power gap methodology the overall story is that two decades ago nine out of university employees on the ontario sunshine list were men as were nine out of professors nine out of deans and three quarters of vice presidents in the ensuing years schools made notable progress hiring more women such that they now represent about one third of university staff representation in leadership has also improved significantly though the bulk of new hires are concentrated in lower level less prestigious jobs below you can see the situation at

hispanic women who make up of the region s population only made up of the overall workforce of senior management and of boards julie jones career development specialist and instructor for the institute for women wellness work at ursuline college said there s no doubt the pandemic has an immense impact on women whether they have been displaced from their job or not it s made them stop and think about what they really want to do jones said a lot of that has to do with the fact that they are taking care of their kids jones said the stress put on women in the last year has caused many to

on handling the issue as sensitively as possible she noted that women often bear a greater responsibility due to childcare sometimes also taking care of elderly parents all while balancing their careers the hospital adopted a work from strategy to help its female employees balance their home life while maintaining their work one of the things we learned from work from home is that we needed to be more flexible in how we think about the work that gets done at home aurilio said aurilio said the hospital is more focused on the outcome and quality of the work not necessarily tying that to when that work is done i think that s been one of the key things we ve done aurilio said aurilio said akron children s is working to support women by normalizing the need for mental health care and

unrest,while it s no secret that small businesses have encountered considerable hardship due to closures and restrictions associated with the covid pandemic some business owners are remaining optimistic and finding ways to continue fostering communities for kevin allan and dannah melad what started as a mission to make the best gluten free cookies possible blossomed into vanilla bite bakery an online bakery they run right out of their apartment the pair had initially started off making cookies for allan s father who has celiac disease starting their business in january during the pandemic posed some unique challenges allan says but the two have still strived to foster relationships with their customers we wanted to treat every customer with the same level of care like we treated my father he says adding building a strong community was always a priority for them according to allan vanilla bite chose to bypass delivery apps completely in order to have a more direct relationship with their customers instead they started going through people they knew as well as working with other businesses and instagram influencers it s not just some random contractor from doordash who leaves it at the door and walks away we actually have a dedicated employee who s invested in the business who cares about our customers and who just happens to be very sociable says allan melad adds she has also connected with online business communities to learn more about growing the bakery and has partnered with other local businesses on their orders when possible the universe has really how small businesses pivoted in the pandemic like melad and allan alessia peluso opened up her caf emily rose cafe during the pandemic according to peluso the caf is named after both of her grandmothers one of whom ran a restaurant for almost years my life has revolved around food my family always revolved around food it s like our love language so i wanted to do something on a smaller scale she says the hardships she faced opening her business during the pandemic included pivoting and adjusting to ongoing changes in covid regulations says peluso it was a little difficult at times because there was never really a clear message of what we re able to do and not to do it was really changing on a more positive note peluso says the struggles she faced created a sense of community for small businesses being tucked away in a residential neighbourhood the support she immediately got from neighbours was heartwarming we were lucky enough that people could still come in and grab stuff people working from home would come in and they could chat with you for two to five minutes while you re making their coffee says peluso i think that was a real positive considering everything going on you could still build relationships having small talk with local customers as well as learning people s names and their orders has blossomed into relationships which is amazing she says the strain on family businesses during covid danish yusef ceo of zensurance says the impact on small businesses has varied from industry to industry according to yusef the ones that have been struggling the most include small coffee shops nail salons and plumbing businesses many of which have shut down during covid on the flip side more white collar jobs like the consultants the engineers lawyers paralegals they ve actually seen their business increase quite a bit he says what we are now seeing with this mixed space of are we opening are we not opening is there s a lot of uncertainty which causes stress to the business owner yusef adds they had lots of demand from owners for insurance after losing money during periods of closures many restaurants for example bought more furniture ahead of preparing to reopen only for ontario to shut down again he says restaurants have been particularly hard hit he says food has been the hardest hit from an insurance standpoint particularly where they serve liquor when it comes to advice for business owners on reopening yusef says there is a lot of uncertainty particularly about what the demand will be like for restaurants and stores more than k small businesses could close permanently amid pandemic cfib for business owners it s just a matter of how certain you are that if you put in of investments that your particular style of business will reopen there s that aspect of whether you want to invest or not he says additionally yusef says noting the modified behaviour of consumers ordering online is also important to consider you have to determine how much of that modified behaviour is going to impact you and whether or not you dabble in that new world of demand he says pointing to an example of a hair salon that started doing hair treatment lessons via zoom the online demand also means businesses can compete and serve customers from around the world he adds for those who have opened a business during the pandemic yusef says there are countless examples of companies that started when times were tough and ended up becoming big many people have started businesses in virtual health care in remote care services in food delivery there are a lot of opportunities so if you re looking to start a business it could be a fantastic time he says and there s a lot of capital available to support people you need to have the right business and the right pitch but there s so much capital available to fund good ideas according to derek hopfner director of revenue at ownr the percentage of new food and service restaurants bars caf s businesses relative to other business categories jumped per cent what this means hopfner says is entrepreneurs are planning for the future and being proactive looking through a macro lens of the food and beverage lens specifically hopfner says it shows there s a pent up demand being anticipated amongst canadians who are looking to spend on tourism food and beverage when it s safe to do so i think there s a general excitement in the community to get out of our houses and meet up with friends and family and share food and conversation in a public space where we ve all been bubbled up over the last months he says globally i think it is a shift to realizing the importance of these types of businesses to regain a sense of community canadian businesses owned by women taking nearly twice as long to recover from covid these entrepreneurs are starting a business to foster that sense of community says hopfner adding post pandemic things like restaurants are a vital part of a vibrant and inclusive environment we re all really excited to see what post pandemic life looks like and we re also appreciative and reliant on the small business community he says they employ so many individuals and are really a core of the community that we re all looking to create again allan says looking forward he s thrilled about meeting customers in person and opening up a physical store opening a business during the peak lockdown in january i feel like it puts us in a unique position to help toronto come out of this he says coronavirus is hurting small businesses peluso adds restaurants and those in the service industry have continued to pivot and find creative ways to adapt it s really amazing to see how people quickly adapt and i think that s going to create a lot of innovation in the future for restaurants and small businesses because we ve had to change so many things from our original planning she says additionally peluso hopes that when businesses start to reopen customers will show respect and gratitude towards workers it s a lot on your mental health to cater to people to take care of people but also keep everybody safe to follow all the protocols she says despite all the difficulties caused by the pandemic peluso says the positivity and sense of community have been incredible to experience there s been a huge sense of community a huge sense of support for small businesses and that s very endearing to see,secret small considerable hardship due associated covid pandemic business optimistic finding way continue fostering kevin allan mission

labour,the eu court of justice has backed aspects of claims by tesco employees regarding equal pay the supreme court had already similarly upheld the claims of asda workers on the same issue by matteo castia the court of justice of the european union on thursday recognized the legitimacy of claims brought forward by some employees of tesco plc in their dispute with the british grocer regarding equal pay the group of around tesco current or former staff have claimed the retail giant has n t been paying men and women equally at its premises the lawsuit arrived at the eu court of justice after the group of employees took their case to a tribunal in watford england the female claimants in the main proceedings submit that their work and that of the male workers employed by tesco stores in the distribution centers in its network are of equal value and that they are entitled to compare their work and that of those workers the court said the grocer s position is that the jobs in its stores and distribution centers are different hence the different pay and that the eu law provisions the claimants refer to are n t directly effective in the context of claims based on work of equal value these roles require different skills and demands which lead to variations in pay but this has absolutely nothing to do with gender a tesco spokesperson told the wall street journal the court backed the claimants views on the case stating that the grocer should be seen as a single entity in terms of employment conditions and referring to the principle of work of equal value the court said that where the differences identified in the pay conditions of workers performing equal work or work of equal value can be attributed to a single source the work and the pay of those workers can be compared even if they work in different establishments the principle laid down by eu law of equal pay for male and female workers can be relied upon directly in respect both of equal work and of work of equal value the court said this specific ruling is n t a judgment on the claims against tesco as the court s pronunciation represents a decision on whether the eu test for comparability of two different roles based in different establishments but within one organization applies directly to private businesses in the uk with its thursday statement the court established that these provisions do apply directly to private businesses in the in accordance with the country s brexit deal with the eu equal pay cases have historically been seen as a public sector issue but private sector businesses ca n t assume they re immune particularly as social media is now used to recruit claimants for mass claims and crowdfunding can be used to fund them law firm howard kennedy partner jane amphlett said in march when asda group ltd found itself involved in a similar case at that time the british retailer was taken to the supreme court by employees seeking compensation on the basis that in the six year period prior to commencing proceedings in they had received less pay than a valid comparator for the same work again lower paid shop staff mostly women argued that they could compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers mostly men on that occasion shop floor workers were supported by labor union gmb which had members involved in the case on march the supreme court upheld the retail employees view as well as an earlier ruling against which asda had appealed the essential question on this appeal was whether common terms apply between the claimants and comparator s establishments satisfying the common terms requirement in the equal pay legislation the supreme court said at the time asda had taken a position similar to tesco s saying the pay gap was dictated by the different nature of the two jobs rather than by gender as there was a substantial difference between the two divisions the pay in our stores and distribution centers is the same for colleagues doing the same jobs regardless of their gender retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and pay rates an asda spokesperson told the wall street journal at the time the supreme court had also made clear that its ruling did n t mean the claimants had won the right to equal pay as the decision just paved the way for them to take further action however as ms amphlett noted back in march the supreme court may had started a path that could well end up with a multimillion pound bill for asda write to matteo castia at,court justice backed regarding equal pay supreme court already similarly upheld issue court justice european union thursday legitimacy brought forward dispute british grocer regarding equal pay group around current former staff retail

religion,people are giving more consideration to insurance cover especially since the advent of the covid pandemic says zurich international life in the middle east zurich in a report its customer benefits paid report revealed that with covid the major health story of the pandemic has had a marked effect on people s behaviour towards financial protection in terms of the biggest threats to life heart attacks and strokes were the biggest risk per cent followed by cancer per cent and accidents per cent covid while a relatively new illness was responsible for per cent of all life insurance claims reveals the report cancer led the list of the gravest critical illness risks followed by heart attacks various chronic conditions and strokes a split by gender reveals that heart attacks were the lead critical illness insurance claim for males per cent while only per cent of females claimed for the same condition cancer led the female benefit claims list per cent with the illness accounting for only per cent of benefit claims for males according to a yougov survey commissioned by zurich only per cent of respondents felt financially prepared for unfortunate family events interestingly more male respondents per cent felt somewhat well prepared compared to per cent of women who felt the same across all age categories more than half of respondents said that due to covid they were somewhat likely or extremely likely to consider purchasing life or critical illness cover with more than per cent of respondents aged saying they purchased life insurance since the start of the global crisis people in the middle east are also paying increased attention to the benefits of a healthier lifestyle with many taking up exercise yoga and other physical and mental wellbeing activities in a bid to reduce or mitigate the risks of developing long term serious illness this is especially prescient when considering that the report reveals of the total amount paid in benefits the split between critical illness and life insurance claims was almost equal this demonstrates that while people are actually living longer more and more people are contracting critical illnesses and dealing with the associated financial impact of managing chronic conditions another import trend to consider is that while there has been an increase in the number of people with pre existing conditions seeking the financial security of insurance protection zurich is still accepting per cent of applications for cover the report shows that per cent of applicants were shown to be overweight with per cent having raised blood sugar levels which can lead to long term serious conditions given the role of females as key decision makers when it comes to household finances it is noteworthy that women tended to find life insurance too expensive to purchase compared to men of those surveyed per cent of women said they don t have insurance because it is too expensive compared to per cent of men who lacked cover for the same reason walter jopp ceo of zurich in the middle east said this report demonstrates that while people are living longer many of us may have to contend with a life threatening situation at some point in the future this is why it s important to be prepared and to consider all options whether that be the potential of contracting a serious illness or even death our survey shows that per cent of respondents don t have life or critical illness cover because they deem it too expensive however people might be surprised to learn we have a range of flexible and affordable cover options for instance we ve launched yourlife and yourcare which are instant simple and accessible solutions with protection starting from just aed per day at zurich we are committed to helping provide financial security and assurance to families whatever the circumstances we are proud to have paid per cent of life insurance claim payments amounting to a total of million in

labour,washington ap the biden administration said thursday it is moving to increase the pay and union rights for security screeners at the nation s airports the department of homeland security directed the acting head of the transportation security administration to come up with a plan within days to raise the pay of the screeners and expand their rights to collective bargaining the change reflects the more labor friendly approach of president joe biden granting a long standing goal of workers at an agency created to improve airport security after the attacks of sept lower pay and benefits than other federal workers has contributed to morale problems and high turnover among the nation s tsa workers who were excluded from the general schedule pay scale and personnel system of most other federal workers when the agency was set up as a component of dhs the american federation of government employees and members of congress have long pushed legislation that would put tsa officers on par with the rest of the federal workforce we are just asking to be put on the same scale as everyone else we are not asking for something different said hydrick thomas president of afge s council which represents tsa officers nationwide starting annual pay for tsa officers is and tops out at an employee of customs and border protection at the same airport would make after six years and have significantly better retirement and other benefits said thomas who is also an officer at john f kennedy airport in new york city the tsa are front line workers too he said every day we put the uniform on we put ourselves in harm s way with the actions being taken by the biden administration tsa officers still wo n t be on equal footing with other federal workers when congress set up the tsa it granted the agency administrator broad authority over the procedures discipline and compensation of the workforce that is n t changing with the directive announced thursday in the memo laying out the administrative actions mayorkas said tsa officers pay should be no less than their counterparts in the federal workforce they will be granted new access to grievance procedures but their collective bargaining rights would only closely mirror those provided under law to other federal employees mayorkas said he has directed the acting tsa administrator to work with the american federation of government employees on a new collective bargaining agreement with the non supervisory members of the workforce it will be similar to other federal agencies but the new agreement will preserve tsa s ability to meet its critical security mission he said without providing further details a bill in congress which has twice before passed the house but not been considered by the senate would put tsa officers in the general schedule along with other federal workers give them access to an independent third party for dispute resolution and ensure the measures being taken under biden could not be undone by a new administration federal employees do not have the right to strike one of the legislation s authors rep bennie thompson a mississippi democrat who chairs the homeland security committee said the new action by the biden administration is significant progress but is n t sufficient tsa frontline officers have been grossly underpaid and denied basic workplace rights

chacma baboon population on the cape peninsula cogh spca said in a statement that they have ensured that the conditions for humane use of paintball markers have been specified in their revised standard operating procedure sop and have confirmed that the new sop takes the welfare of the baboons into consideration while we have no legal power to prohibit the use of paintball markers to deter

other,british columbia and washington state are joining forces for a cross border effort to find and eradicate asian giant hornet nests this summer sometimes called murder hornets the insects are an invasive species native to east and south asia that threaten to destroy honey bee colonies which are important for bc and washington s agriculture industries both jurisdictions are laying out traps for the asian giant hornets to detect where they re living and lead investigators back to their nests to destroy them officials are asking citizen scientists on both sides of the border to lay out their own simple pop bottle style traps and contact the appropriate agency in bc or washington if they spot an unusually large hornet we would like to use the public s eyes to report sightings because we don t have enough resources to be everywhere all the time sven erik spichiger managing entomologist with the washington state department of agriculture said at a wednesday news conference officials suggest using a mixture of water and brown sugar to attract the insects but orange juice grape juice and rice wine will also work after being spotted for the first time in bc in and several more times on both sides of the border last summer scientists and agricultural officials say the pressure is on to eradicate the invasive insect before it establishes itself in the pacific northwest the hornets are known to attack honey bees and will slaughter entire colonies in a matter of hours by decapitating the bees then they ll take over the bee colony as their own and eat the young they threaten to cause untold damage to the pacific northwest s beekeeping industry which will in turn make it more difficult to grow certain types of produce the lower mainland is known for such as blueberries the hornets nest in the ground and will aggressively defend their home if disturbed paul van westendorp bc s provincial apiculturist recounted how a nest was found in nanaimo in that was next to a public park and walkway if a dog or child had sniffed the nest they could have been attacked if there s direct exposure to you of a hornet s nest absolutely there is danger to your health and well being he added the hornets are an apex predator and they will kill other native species of wasps and hornets eliminating those middle predators could upset the insect ecosystem leading to more types of unwanted bugs here officials believe the hornets were introduced via marine traffic coming into one of bc or washington s ports they suspect a young queen could have insulated herself in a shipping container or vehicle and emerged here in the spring to set up a new nest they added more invasive species could be introduced this way in the future van westendorp believes the fraser valley is the most attractive ecosystem for the asian giant hornets and doesn t think they ll establish themselves in bc s evergreen forests or further east in the interior that s why he s particularly focused on asking bc beekeepers to monitor for the hornets with consistent predation from humans in the form of trapping and extermination van westendorp hopes asian giant hornets can be brought under control this year last year in bc there were six confirmed sightings of asian giant hornets south of the border washington state reported confirmed sightings plus at least insects found at a nest that was destroyed spichiger shared a map of the traps planted for this summer where the focus is near previous sightings in places such as whatcom skagit san juan island jefferson and clallam counties birch bay custer and blaine washington state department of agriculture he believes putting out a trap is in people s best interest because it s safer to know in advance if there are asian giant hornets in your area rather than unwittingly disturbing a nest this is not a species that we want to tolerate here in the us and certainly not in washington state spichiger,british columbia washington state

unrest,for the days israeli air strikes pummelled gaza dr khamis would try to take a two hour nap around am the only time he could catch some much needed rest israel would carpet bomb different areas of the strip at roughly pm every night when there was no electricity in most parts of gaza city the kids would cry and scream the huge supersonic explosions spread a lot of fear among the children he recalls the darkness increased their terror major infrastructure including electricity and also roads and water supplies were damaged by strikes at night there is nowhere to escape to during the daytime at least they can seek refuge in another room or on the staircase dr khamis elessi is a palestinian neuro rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant who has lived in different parts of the world before returning home to gaza he studied and worked in the philippines sheba medical centre in tel aviv southampton and oxford in the uk he says that of all the five previous military confrontations he has lived through this was undoubtedly the worst roughly people lost their lives including children many of them died whilst they were sleeping he says they were just crushed under the ceiling of their building dr khamis spent his days following up with his medical students online that is if they had the electricity to be able to log in and listen sometimes helping patients over the phone or tending to the wounded at shifa hospital most of the time i tried to psychologically and spiritually support my nuclear and extended family members which totalled more than individuals in one night he says on the seventh day of the escalation the situation took a turn for the worse the israeli army spokesman announced that in less than one hour military aeroplanes dropped missiles onto the eastern and northern side of the gaza strip everyone inside our building was screaming and frozen inside his or her body but there was no time for me to cry or feel scared he recounts while his family were listening to these gigantic explosions his daughter a final year physiotherapist fainted and collapsed with clenched mouth and cyanosed lips because of the fear she had n t eaten for five days with very limited light dr khamis spent more than minutes helping her regain full consciousness and tried to put two tablespoons of honey into her mouth all the kids and his mother were crying before she fully regained consciousness one of my nieces fainted because of the commotion he recalls fifteen minutes after i revived her a second niece fainted then a third i asked my wife and stepsister to do to them like what i did to the others the time by then was am so i was completely exhausted and went to take a nap for minutes dr khamis never had the opportunity to take his nap because as he collapsed into a chair he heard screaming from his brother s house next door his niece had given birth to her first baby just a few hours ago and when she heard the fresh round of bombing she also collapsed and was convulsing at that moment i had the feeling of being completely helpless because you ca n t do anything to protect your kids or family he says during wars this is a typical day for us here in gaza for some respite palestinians living in gaza would often head to the long stretch of coast on the mediterranean to relax however because israel bombed the sewage system and there is no electricity local municipalities have been forced to push sewage into the sea so now the only refuge for the people to seek leisure time has been banned because the sea is now highly polluted with sewage water says dr khamis there are two main parks on the strip but they are barely big enough for of the million people who live in gaza he added during the offensive more than residential units were totally destroyed including seven towers unfortunately our healthcare system has been on the verge of collapse for the last years because of the ongoing siege on gaza from air land and sea but still we have the right to live like any other citizen worldwide with free access to healthcare a grainy surveillance video released last week captured the targeting of al remal clinic gaza s main covid laboratory it shows patients and staff running as smoke fills the corridors until eventually you can see nothing but a grey cloud just before the war gaza had managed to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections which were down from a day to a day several medics feared cases would rise again as thousands of palestinians sought refuge in unrwa schools and each other s homes but fortunately they have n t dr khamis now thinks that gaza has almost reached herd immunity before the air strikes there was already a shortage of medicine and medical staff roughly per cent of children under the age of five and women at childbearing age are anaemic because of the lack of fresh vegetables available and almost million people of the gaza strip s total population are refugees who rely on regular food assistance from international humanitarian organisations palestinian children hold candles during a rally amid the ruins of houses destroyed by israeli strikes in gaza city on may slogans in arabic reads stop the crimes of the occupation of palestine mohammed abed afp via getty images a report found that per cent of children in gaza suffer from ptsd i think this percentage might have now reached per cent says dr khamis the situation here is really miserable i think not only children but every palestinian in gaza needs psychological counselling and treatment dr khamis lost two colleagues and friends in the strikes head of internal medicine dr ayman abu al ouf who was killed at home along with his wife and all members of his family and also his sister with all of her family members also killed on the same night was dr moein aloul a neurologist aloul was also killed along with his family and four other families who were completely crushed under the roof of their homes in six apartments in one block during air strikes that hit al wehda in the early hours of the morning leaving a total of killed and more than individuals injured meet the palestinian building preschools to help children to survive and thrive now days after the ceasefire palestinians have taken a deep sigh of relief says dr khamis finally there is no more bombing and shelling and we hope this will last for good palestinians have started to clear rubble from the streets and move parts of the demolished buildings to clear the way for cars to pass through they also started removing the broken glass and debris from the different hospitals and clinics including al remal clinic which hopes to be back on its feet and serving the community very soon gaza has received unprecedented global pledges that still need to be followed through on including from the us with a total of billion pledged if that materialises gaza will become a state of the art city even if one third of these pledges reach gaza it would be possible to build new homes and buildings for all those that lost their homes says dr khamis however we do n t just need reconstruction medicine and food for now and then the international community to just forget about the root cause which is the ongoing israeli siege and occupation of palestinian land and the non stop israeli settlers and police incitements against muslims in jerusalem and sheikh jarrah i always advise relatives friends students and colleagues that we have to remain positive in our thoughts and our expectations as well because without it we will die he continues many people ask me this question when i keep saying be positive we still have hope and things will be better why do you feel optimistic all the time i tell them it s because hope for a better tomorrow is the only thing we have and it is the only thing we will have for sure and without hope we will die without hope you will find me dead,day israeli air

social,transgender rights activist and celebrity publicist yaya mavundla has reached a new milestone in her journey she has now been legally recognised as a woman after she was granted a new id number by the department of home affairs taking to instagram mavundla announced the news to her followers on wednesday saying i received my new id number that identifies me as female so much is about to happen for us transgender people we are one step closer i encourage more trans people to go apply she applied for her new id number in november last year and was given a few hassles by home affairs when they first told her they would n t be able to assist her as she didn t have a copy of her mother s id whom she never got a chance to meet they told me they wouldn t be able to assist me without one and i said no that s fine if you guys are saying you cannot assist me then i m more than happy to take this matter to court i want justice not just for myself but for many other trans people as well she said mavundla was then advised that she could get an affidavit stating that she does not have those documents this then assisted her towards the next step if they had been adamant that they would n t assist me i would have been more than happy to take the matter to court said mavundla born and bred in kranskop a small town in kwazulu natal mavundla who comes from a largely rural background said she s always wanted trans visibility so this breakthrough speaks to the people who come from such spaces she started her activism work on lgbti communities when she joined the durban lesbian and gay community health centre as a youth leader from to when she began the process of getting a new id number so she can apply for one she realised it was not an easy journey i realised that after having started the process last year with home affairs it is certainly not an easy process for the average person sitting at home being on television and being in the public eye helped me get the process done i had access to many people at home affairs through the show but can you imagine a person who does not have access who needs to join a queue and stand there for hours and deal with the attitude given by home affairs officials while i m grateful and happy that this is now happening for me i m not fully excited because i m now thinking what then happens to a trans person who does not have that access she said she added that many factors come into play for trans people who want to be legally granted the gender recognition they wish i was asked to provide a copy of my mother s id so if i ve never had the opportunity to meet my mother where then do i get a copy of her id what then happens to a trans who does not have a relationship at all with their parents because of their gender where then does this leave us while she hasn t applied for her id document yet her new id number reflects that she is female and she will now be able to apply for it in the capacity of being a woman when you apply for one an id it is treated as a replacement of the old one it s almost as though you have lost your id and you are off to get a new one she said on what more needs to be done mavundla said we need to get the government to get more work done many south africans pay tax so that the work can be done we don t pay tax to get load shedding we don t pay tax to struggle when we need to go to the clinic or a government hospital if we are not getting those services it means the government is not at work so we need to put pressure on the government for these services to be granted to us she said according to pierre brouard acting director at the centre for sexualities aids and gender at the university of pretoria people have for quite a while now been able to change their gender marker on their identity document and that requires you to get a new identity number because currently how our identity numbers work is that they signify whether you re male or female obviously for a trans person who doesn t identify with the sex assigned at birth it is distressing and according to our legal system people are now allowed to legally change their gender marker the system also allows you to change your name as well so that it aligns with your chosen or new identity he said according to him the challenge presented in a number of spheres is that there is a gap in terms of the starting application process and actually the changes being made it can take a couple of years in some instances in effect you are living in some kind of limbo because you are presenting in the world your gender identity but your id presents your assigned gender and so your workplace systems operate off your legal identity access is also a big issue where not everyone has access to these systems it s one thing to have a law in place it s another to have access to those legal systems to your personal advantage said brouard on what more needs to be done he believes issues concerning people of the lgbti need to be handled with sensitivity trans issues are spoken about in a way that is for click bait where they are salacious disrespectful and demeaning to people and i think presenting trans issues in a way that is thoughtful and respectful would be part of the solution she said,activist celebrity publicist yaya new milestone journey legally woman new number

what s called a content delivery network an arrangement that allows customer websites to store data such as images and videos on various mirror servers across countries keeping the data closer to

environmental,concerns among some residents about safety in a dimly lit community and a desire by others for the serenity of a starry night are putting many gladers on opposite sides of an issue of whether there should be more street lights some say the safety of residents should require more lights especially in a community dominated by older people who have difficulty seeing at night and have greater fear of crime the issue came to light in march after the fairfield glade community club board of directors sent an email blast written by the board s environment committee to residents explaining the consequences of light pollution light pollution is artificial light that inappropriately shines on neighbors properties and illuminates the sky the committee also shared outdoor lighting principles promoted by the international dark sky association which strives to protect the night sky from light pollution residents quickly chimed in some say the safety of residents should require more lights especially in a community dominated by older people who have difficulty seeing at night and have greater fear of crime some in favor of dark skies note that fairfield glade is a rural community in the mountains and that people who move here should understand that this isn t the city the issue came to light in march after the fairfield glade community club board of directors sent an email blast written by the board s environment committee to residents explaining the consequences of light pollution light pollution is artificial light that inappropriately shines on neighbors properties and illuminates the sky the committee also shared outdoor lighting principles promoted by the international dark sky association which strives to protect the night sky from light pollution the issue has been a hot topic of debate on the social media site nextdoor where there are hundreds of comments from dozens of fairfield glade residents favoring or opposing more street lighting one such resident ken snyder sees the need for safety but also for aesthetics and he hopes the community can achieve a good balance with a solution that benefits both sides while he favors fewer street lights he said he understands that some people want more lights to feel safer but he said street lights are just one strategy toward that end and that there are others such as reflective road lines and motion detectors on properties that also would allow residents to revere the night it s really important for everyone to understand the needs of others snyder said in a telephone interview with the sun unless we begin with an expressed empathic appreciation for the valid needs of others we re starting behind the ball some did wedgworth said in an email to the sun that over the past month the board heard from several residents about the issue he declined to release further details and said the board had no additional comments beyond its monthly may magnified email newsletter in which it was said there are no plans to add street lights but it identified eight intersections on peavine rd where volunteer energy cooperative is to install street lights upon completion of the sr peavine rd expansion project the board also wrote that it reviewed data from the glade s police department and found no reports involving automobile accidents pedestrian injuries or burglaries where streetlights would have prevented those types of incidents police chief mike williams said the board asked for information on those three types of reports for certain neighborhoods going back two years the department gave the board its data on all incidents not just of those three categories which included automobile crash data going back only one year williams said in the past that street lights had been installed in areas where lack of lighting could have contributed to incidents such as traffic accidents and such incidents have happened one or two times in the six years i ve been here the board said the glade has street lights at major intersections and in various neighborhoods although there are no plans to add street lights the board left open the possibility that there could be fewer going forward depending on safety considerations in the future when a streetlight in a neighborhood burns out it will be reviewed for safety concerns if no safety concerns are found to exist the affected streetlight could be removed the board wrote the board said future magnified newsletters will explain how residents can safely light homes for protection and enjoy dark skies they

lifestyle,hot travel bookings over the past two months and an emboldened attitude among prospective travelers may mean the long cold covid winter is finally over recent news articles indicate available lodging and rental cars in popular destinations are already booked for the season it s no wonder cdc data shows nearly of the population has received one vaccination shot or more according to a survey conducted by destination analysts as of memorial day the number of americans concerned about contracting the coronavirus the pandemic s impact on personal finances as well as the national economy hit historic lows the average perception of travel and leisure activities as unsafe was cut in half compared to the beginning of the year and business travel is on the rise again too it is encouraging to see travelers leave behind some of their pandemic fears and venture out once again even so before they take off on their next business trip they should stay vigilant and remember that many hotels venues buildings and attractions have been closed or operating at less than half capacity for some time in many cases shutting down included their hvac systems just flipping the switch from off to on does not solve the problem the increased humidity and stale air inside facilities whose hvac systems have lain dormant for weeks or even months could create a breeding ground for mold and bacteria such conditions could result in serious health concerns for guests hopefully the hotel in question has had a full hvac system evaluation and a comprehensive hvac environmental cleaning before inviting guests to return based on our experience with hundreds of hotels across the united states and according to microbiologists and building scientists on our staff there are a few signs travelers should watch out for as they assess the quality of their lodging if a traveler sees one of the following five signs it may indicate that management is not taking guests safety into account in relation to mold bacteria or covid itself if service records for environmental testing and cleaning are not prominently posted then management is not taking operations during current pandemic conditions seriously whether it s the virus mold or some other issue now is no time to become complacent with indoor air quality for guests lack of new air cleaning monitoring technology dusty floors and walls such conditions should sound the alarm for poor indoor air quality and indicate the hvac system may have maintenance issues if the topical cleaning plan is outdated or not posted in your hotel room it is very likely your hotel has become a petri dish for pathogens smells can be a major warning indicator of bacterial or mold growth in the building or hvac system travelers should consider following their noses to a safer room in addition to being vigilant about these warning signs travelers also should remember the importance of wearing masks in crowded spaces in conclusion there is no one silver bullet that hotel and venue managers can use to ensure that covid and other pathogens are prevented from recirculating through their hvac systems like security indoor air quality is improved in layers and combined approaches as travelers enter lodging they should keep an eye out for the five warning signs mentioned if travelers are still in the booking process they should never hesitate to pick up the phone and ask management about the last time the hvac was serviced and environmentally cleaned ask what extra steps the resort has taken to ensure its facilities indoor air quality is optimized travelers will breathe easier both figuratively and literally knowing their hotel or venue management is doing all it can to keep them healthy and safe,hot travel past two attitude among prospective may mean long cold covid winter finally recent news indicate available lodging rental popular already booked season wonder data nearly population received one

weather,climate disclosures have been increasingly scrutinised by investors and regulators globally and top lawyers say company directors could be liable for failing to understand and disclose climate risks could be sued for failing to act on those risks once known and may be liable for misleading or deceptive conduct for selectively disclosing exposures to climate change or declaring green goals while lacking credible plans to achieve them the arguments have gained the backing of the reserve bank of australia asic the australian prudential regulation authority the asx corporate governance committee and the australian accounting standards board the taskforce on climate related financial disclosures tcfd is now seen as the global standard for informing shareholders of the climate related risks faced by companies however the cdp igcc and the pri argue more is needed to be done particularly to align reporting of climate related disclosures across major jurisdictions amid signs of support from the major g economies to consider making disclosures mandatory the report confusion to clarity plan for mandatory tcfd in australia finds that although the number of asx companies that have adopted the tcfd framework has increased from in to in only per cent of the top companies have set emissions targets and most are only for the short term moreover in the analysis where companies assess how they would fare under different environmental outcomes companies use different scenarios making it hard to compare and contrast the report also found companies made limited attempts to be transparent on the assumptions and inputs that led to their scenario modelling while there was a low uptake of scenario modelling based on a warmer world which suggests companies were ignoring a tougher stress test on their portfolios the issue also extended to companies most vulnerable to the transition away from fossil fuels and energy intensive sectors with many companies in the markets opting to hide assumptions underpinning climate analysis the assumptions have real world implications with the assets company strategic direction and intangible goods all vulnerable to sharp changes in value due to physical risks presented by climate change or the realities of changing government policy and technologies questionable assumptions and inputs may be causing overly optimistic views of future cash flows under a c or below scenarios the report said few companies provide meaningful disclosure on physical risk last year asic warned five companies and their auditors they risked breaking the law because of non disclosure of climate change risks strike energy and its auditor deloitte the million carnarvon petroleum and ey africa focused pancontinental oil gas perth based whitebark energy and kpmg and the million leigh creek energy and auditor grant thornton all received warnings from the regulator as it ramps up its regulation of climate related disclosures for shareholders the investor groups behind the report recommend asic review its guidance to ensure companies use the tcfd framework and enforce top firms adherence while apra should update its prudential guidance to ensure regulated entities adhere to the tcfd meanwhile treasury should look to find the most efficient way to implement disclosure requirements and the asx should introduce on an if not why not basis mandatory disclosure for asx firms by next year and all other companies by cdp chief paul simpson said australia should be developing its own mandatory regime as a matter of priority to ensure the ongoing stability of the financial system and to remain competitive with global counterparts igcc policy director erwin jackson said the phased implementation of climate disclosures was an opportunity to reduce red tape for businesses and to support investment australian and global institutional investors are seeking to make multi billion dollar investments in the transition to net zero emissions today mr erwin said pri chief fiona reynolds said the voluntary disclosure system was reaching the limits of what it could deliver establishing a mandatory regime would provide much needed clarity for companies and financial organisations she said australian council of superannuation investors boss louise davidson welcomed the plan investors need detailed disclosure of climate related risks to adequately understand their exposure ms davidson said s p global sustainable head of asia pacific esg business development michael salvatico said the market is indicating strong support for disclosures the demand continues to rise for comparable and consistent scenario analysis to enable companies to unlock capital he said,climate increasingly globally top say company could liable

politics,foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi on tuesday expressed concern over the rising trend of islamophobic attacks in the western world and called on the global community to pay attention and arrest the trend immediately he made the comments while speaking about the killing of four members of a pakistan origin family in canada late on sunday evening in what the canadian police termed as a premeditated attack a year old suspect had rammed a pickup truck into the family of five who were reportedly out on their daily walk killing four of them and injuring the fifth a nine year old boy there is evidence that this was a planned premeditated act motivated by hate it is believed that these victims were targeted because they were muslim detective superintendent paul waight told a news conference the names of the victims were not released but they include a year old woman a year old man a year old woman and a year old girl together representing three generations of the same family according to the city s mayor ed holder speaking on the floor of the national assembly on tuesday qureshi said he had contacted pakistan s consul general in ontario as well as the country s high commissioner in canada for information adding that details of the attack made his heart shake and eyes wet we are seeing the trend of islamophobic attacks for some time and they are on the rise in the western world for the last two years we are bringing global attention to this that this is a trend not individual acts he said western governments may want to colour it as the act of a crazed man or an individual act but if we see the trajectory this is a rising trend and it is concerning qureshi said he was concerned the rising trend had started to divide societies the foreign minister said around million muslims resided in europe two million in canada and six million or more in the united states because of which the western world will have to pay attention to this this rising trend of islamophobia will have to be arrested immediately if western countries do not do this the situation can worsen society can be divided hate speech incitement conflict can be created emotions arise and tragedies happen he warned he said prime minister imran khan had also talked about islamophobia in the past stressing that the muslim ummah should be united and decide on a plan of action if only pakistan raises its voice it will not be that effective if we all raise our voices that will be effective qureshi emphasised adding that he had submitted a resolution on the instructions of pm imran during the th session of the oic council of foreign ministers in niamey asking the body to take up the problem with one voice the resolution was not only adopted unanimously but muslim countries also directed their permanent representatives to the united nations in new york to take up the matter and build the international community s consensus on the issue he shared pakistan s ambassador to the un munir akram was also playing his role he added qureshi said that according to his conversation with pakistan s consul general in ontario there was a hour gap between the incident and when the family was informed our consul general was the first person to talk to the family and listen to them he disclosed i believe that this is not only a hate crime and there is no doubt that four counts of murder are applicable to the suspect but we cannot rule out terrorism he said giving details about the family he said they hailed from lahore and had moved to canada years ago the father was a physiotherapist and the family had spent ordinary lives living in peace and nobody had any complaints with them he added only faith related hate can be seen in the incident that happened to them the family s only sin was that they were from a society and a religion that repeats the kalima qureshi said the family was shocked and grieving and was hesitant to talk to the media right now however the deceased man s brother who lived in australia had been contacted and he was flying to canada he said that canadian prime minister justin trudeau had tweeted about the incident and adopted a clear stance which is encouraging in his tweet trudeau had said he was horrified by the attack to the loved ones of those who were terrorised by yesterday s act of hatred we are here for you he said singling out the nine year old boy in hospital to the muslim community in london and to muslims across the country know that we stand with you islamophobia has no place in any of our communities this hate is insidious and despicable and it must stop he added talking about trudeau s tweet qureshi said it was the same stance that had been taken by pakistan and the oic he said he had shared the pakistani nation s emotions and concerns with canadian high commissioner to pakistan wendy gilmour the foreign minister recalled new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern s response to the shootings at two mosques in christchurch and said the canadian premier who was very enlightened and progressive should also step up and rise to the occasion qureshi suggested trudeau should meet the family of those killed saying it would reassure them he also requested the pakistani community in canada to play their role and express solidarity with the family and console them he also shared that the federal government had offered help to the family to bring back the bodies to pakistan but they said they do not want it we are in contact with the canadian government and we are taking our policy on islamophobia forward he added qureshi said international human rights organisations should discuss the attack because this is a human rights incident he called upon the international media to not ignore this incident either so the global community could adopt a plan of action based on a holistic view against this trend,foreign minister shah tuesday expressed concern rising trend western world

weather,paper on profession s future paints one dystopian scenario of ravages of ai with elite cadre of lawyers on performance enhancing drugs the law society of england and wales has envisaged the future and found it to be potentially rather bleak with city lawyers being encouraged to take performance enhancing medication to remain competitive predicting a future in which consumer services like property and private client law are delivered by large retail legal service providers it says commercial law firms will see large swathes of routine legal advice outsourced leaving an elite cadre of city and in house lawyers to advise in person the cost pressures on the legal sector to adopt ai and streamline legal functions will lead to more work types being commoditised automated and self service in the near term the report finds only the high value complex or newest areas of law will need human input humans may also be needed in relationship management with larger clients it warns those lawyers that remain in high end jobs the report says will be generally immune to a radical reduction in staff the future worlds project was set up to enable raw frank and honest discussions around what clients will need in the future its first report images of the future worlds facing the legal profession pulls few punches drawing on a delphi panel of futurologists and previously published research by kpmg the report sketches competing visions of the future one cautious the other more apocalyptic cautious assessments of workforce change suggest a decline by while the more catastrophic modelling envisages savage job cuts leading to a reduction in the legal workforce law society president stephanie boyce said the legal profession is at a pivotal moment as is the world in which we live there are a plethora of forces shifting our collective experience and the business environment if we ve learnt anything from it s that the future can still catch you unawares the report forecasts extensive change to law firm partnerships by with extensive deskilling of the legal profession as ai takes over and dramatic changes in compensation as a result meaning that by everyone has a free lawyer at their disposal similar to siri it adds that in one dystopian scenario lawyers remaining within the profession must work alongside technology and are required to take performance enhancing medication in order to optimise their own productivity and other likely challenges include china s dominance as an economic and political superpower aspects of which can already be seen in recent events in hong kong as well as issues arising from green energy and climate change boyce said new forms of green energy and climate change action could create opportunities for lawyers and their insurer clients as they seek to find innovative solutions to the risks posed by extreme weather events legal input and advice will also be needed around green funding investors financing environmentally friendly companies and there is likely to be a rise in climate litigation against corporations or governments in a more optimistic passage the report suggests technology could be leveraged in creative and socially advantageous ways to democratise access to justice in the legal sphere tackle environmental degradation and revolutionise health outcomes boyce concluded this project is a unique opportunity to look ahead at the challenges and opportunities that may face us in the next decade science fiction is already becoming a reality so what can we look forward to in years time we intend to illuminate the path ahead for the profession so the future may be a little less uncertain,paper profession future one scenario elite cadre performance law society future found

weather,ipbes to assess transformational changes to tackle biodiversity loss the forthcoming assessment will consider different scenarios for a sustainable world for nature and people in line with the vision for biodiversity and in the context of the agenda for sustainable development including visions of indigenous peoples and local communities it will also assess the determinants and processes of transformative change potential obstacles and options for action as well as how progress can be tracked the secretariat of the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes issued a scoping report for a thematic assessment of the underlying causes of biodiversity loss and the determinants of transformative change required to address it the assessment will provide decision makers with options to implement such change to achieve the vision for biodiversity and the sdgs ipbes is an independent intergovernmental body established by countries to enhance the science policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity long term human well being and sustainable development the multidisciplinary expert panel which oversees all ipbes scientific and technical functions will present the scoping report ipbes to the ipbes plenary for consideration at its eighth session convening virtually from june the scoping report highlights that the need for rapid transformative change which it defines as a fundamental system wide reorganization across technological economic and social factors including paradigms goals and values became apparent during the covid pandemic according to the ipbes global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services there are plausible pathways for achieving the vision for biodiversity and other global goals but these necessitate fundamental changes in development paradigms and social ecological dynamics these pathways require changes in society more sustainable use of land water energy and materials as well as changes in consumption habits food systems and global value chains the forthcoming assessment will consider different scenarios for a sustainable world for nature and people in line with the vision for biodiversity and in the context of the agenda for sustainable development including visions of indigenous peoples and local communities it will also assess the determinants and processes of transformative change potential obstacles and options for action as well as how progress can be tracked the assessment will identify

and co evolve with indirect drivers of change the assessment will take into account ways in which values influence behavior and how this differs regionally and between levels of development it will also take into consideration notions of good quality of life worldviews and cultures models of interaction between nature and people and social narratives other factors to be considered include equity and the need for just transitions obstacles to achieving transformative change and lessons learned from previous transitions crises and transformations will also be considered intended for among others governments governing bodies of multilateral environmental agreements meas decision makers in global policy frameworks subnational governments and local authorities scientists the private sector and civil society the assessment will strengthen the knowledge base for informed decision making in the context of the post global biodiversity framework the vision for biodiversity the agenda

labour,image credit supplied if one thing has become increasingly apparent as a result of the pandemic it is the importance of community in the traditional sense community is defined as a group of people linked by geographical location however as a result of globalisation the term is synonymous with shared perspectives and common interests with geography becoming obsolete as a prerequisite for the formation of a strong community the pandemic has highlighted that as a global community our futures are tightly intertwined and our own personal and professional successes are dependent upon those of our colleagues neighbours friends and family in short our tribe in this sense community does not need to be simply defined as a group of people with whom we share interests but rather those upon which we rely on for mutual support after all when others thrive so do we trust is an essential component for any strong community and this was central to our approach to reimagining remittances there are communities that do not have access to conventional banking and this needs to change democratising the banking sector should be a key priority in a post covid world as a global society we must not ignore the more than one billion people worldwide who do not have a bank account rather we must empower them to become the bank their community needs and have access to tech solutions that will enable them to financially support their tribe low income expatriate workers have been especially vulnerable to effects of the pandemic the traditional way in which many transferred their wages home proved to be wildly ineffective as exchange bureaus were forced to close this had a huge impact upon workers ability to send money to families at a time when they needed it most additionally many of the home countries of low income expatriate workers in the uae including india have been especially hard hit by the pandemic by giving individuals the means in which to take full control of their finances including how they choose to support their families we can evolve global banking in a way that caters to the masses as opposed to just the privileged fintech solutions aimed at democratising the banking system must take into account a crucial component namely trust and transparency traditional banks do not do enough to provide financial control to hard working individuals many of whom send up to per cent of their wages thousands of miles away by enabling expatriate workers to share access to their credit or debit cards with those that they trust they can provide vital funds to their community of choice safely securely and instantly this means that community members no longer need to rely upon banks to grant them loans but rather can depend upon the trust earned amongst their peers to access credit and trust has the potential to be a gamechanger enabling communities to make their own decisions about how they financially support one another based on their vast inter personal experiences can form a key pillar in post covid economic recovery there is no reason why credit should be confined within the borders of one nation when it can be effectively utilised and repaid by trusted family and community members around the globe we are passionate about creating technology that allows just this that empowers individuals to decide how their wages and credit is utilised based on trust,image credit one thing become increasingly apparent result pandemic importance community traditional sense community defined group people linked geographical location however

weather,there s nothing more enticing than an apparently easy solution to a complex in point electric vehicles evs have been getting a high profile boost lately over and above the usual hype as politicians from president biden down to state and local officials have been pushing them as a primary way to reduce carbon emissions from transportation the largest contributor to climate change both nationally and statewide now it is certainly true that if you re going to drive a motor vehicle in most cases it is environmentally better to go a mile in an ev than in a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle even with today s typical electric generation mix but despite lacking a tailpipe evs are far from an environmental panacea there are several reasons beyond the simple inefficiency of using a pound machine to move a pound person by driving up electricity demand evs make it harder to shut down coal and gas powered generation plants we re in a race to build enough renewable generation to replace carbon emitting generation and plugging in more power hungry evs moves the finish line farther out it also means that when we do eventually replace all fossil fueled generation we ll have more miles of high voltage transmission lines and hundreds of thousands more acres covered with solar panels and wind turbines than we would need to power a more efficient transportation system production of evs is extremely resource intensive beyond the usual steel and plastic and synthetic rubber needed for any car evs require large amounts of lithium for batteries and rare earth elements for motors the new york times recently highlighted the environmental hazards of lithium mining and rare earth production dominated by china has been environmentally devastating most importantly evs do nothing to change our typical sprawling land consuming development pattern that s enabled by private motor vehicles in the northern front range alone we see hundreds of acres of prairie farmland or forest devoured every year by car enabled car dependent development travel to the dwindling area between broomfield and erie or to the once tiny now sprawling burbs of frederick firestone and dacono to see the vast tracts eaten up by a combination of nimbyism which pushes development out of city centers where it would be more sustainable and a car centric transportation system which enables it to manifest instead as low density sprawl in the hinterlands the solution of course is not to stick with petroleum powered cars the ev evangelists are right about this the solution rather is to step back and rebuild our transportation and land use system in a way that s far more sustainable centered around human powered modes and transit switching from a gasoline car to an ev is not too much more of a shift than changing incandescent light bulbs to leds hence the appeal changing the way our cities look and work and feel is a far bigger undertaking to its credit the biden administration seems to be taking on this challenge if not to the degree necessary to really address climate change at least far more seriously than any previous administration at the state level the democrats transportation bill sb takes baby steps towards changing a century s worth of unsustainable car centric highway planning but still includes million in subsidies for evs plus hundreds of millions of dollars for highway widening digging us further into a hole of unsustainability meanwhile there seems to be little appetite for taking the lead at the state level in guiding us towards a more environmentally friendly land use pattern and in boulder we have declared a climate emergency and set some ambitious goals for a more sustainable transportation system but we are not on target to even come close to meeting them evs must be part of the solution but the core of our approach must be a fundamental rebuilding of our cities around less driving and fewer cars it s a daunting challenge and a long term project to undo a century s worth of auto centric planning but it s the only way to create a truly sustainable transportation system,nothing enticing apparently easy

social,co founder of black lives matter movement patrisse cullors attends the united state of women summit on may in los angeles calif photo by valerie macon afp via getty images there are lots of reasons why wokeism spread like wildfire once america lost its collective mind during the pandemic quarantine self induced recession and rioting of wokeism was never really about racism sexism or other isms for some it illustrated a psychological pathology of projection transferring one s own prejudices onto others in order to alleviate or mask them so should we laugh or cry that black lives matter s self described marxist co founder might be a corporate grifter according to a new york post report patrisse khan cullors has accumulated several upscale homes and one of her foundations failed to report significant donations to the irs is it the case that the more khan cullors professes marxist ideology and damns toxic whiteness the more she feels comfortable living in a million home in southern california s ritzy topanga canyon area sheldon whitehouse d an outspoken liberal icon he s one of the senate s most woke members yet whitehouse turns out to be a member of a de facto all white beach club of elites in newport rhode island is whitehouse committed in the abstract to rooting out white privilege so he can concretely relax amid it with fellow bluebloods barack and michelle obama occasionally venture out of their multimillion dollar washington mansion or their martha s vineyard estate to lecture the country on its systemic racism does such sermonizing square the circle that the obamas have no desire to return to their chicago home a city where hundreds of african american males were murdered in most of them by other black men joe biden frequently lectures america on its racism and he unleashed the bureaucracies of the federal government to root out mythical white supremacist conspiracies does penance explain biden s fixation on systemic racism when he condemns anonymous white racists does his outrage mitigate his son hunter s reported use of an anti asian slur in a text message the second catalyst of wokeism is the distraction it provides from scary problems that threaten american civilization while the country consumes itself in demanding more than representation of black actors in television commercials it is nearing trillion in national debt eventually the astounding red ink will require recessionary belt tightening more inflationary money printing or both the woke biden administration can t stop hundreds of thousands of immigrants from illegally entering the united states this year almost all are in need of free american health care housing food and legal subsidies violent crime is spiking at an alarming rate yet few dare say why that is or how to stop it america can t seem to face the likelihood that chinese researchers engineered a gain of function virus with oversight from the chinese military and subsidies from the united states so instead of offering real solutions to these crises we war with each other over whether the deceased children s book author dr seuss or the plastic toy mr potato head were racist or otherwise exclusionary when our elites are clueless about national debt inflation illegal immigration crime soaring gas prices and a global pandemic they reassure themselves that at least they can cancel out father junipero serra or knock down another statue of robert e lee finally the hysterias of wokeism are being channelled for profit if they do not already reflect the reality of many of our most woke being the richest among us one reason why oprah winfrey meghan markle and lebron james hype charges of white racism is to remind america that one can become rich as croesus yet remain a sympathetic victim for next generation grifters such as ibram x kendi and robin diangelo to claim that america was is and always will be racist means more than just speaking gigs and book sales the solution for the pseudo crises they invent is the mass re education of self confessional whites with lucrative consulting fees for both and for thousands of others america is systematically being conned by those

to the outskirts of the provincial capital of kunming in this june photo released by the yunnan forest fire brigade a member of a migrating herd of elephants rests near xinyang township in jinning district of kunming city in southwestern china s yunnan province already famous at home china s wandering elephants are now becoming international stars major global media including satellite news stations news papers and wire services are chronicling the herd s more than year long kilometer mile trek from their home in a wildlife reserve in mountainous southwest yunnan province to the outskirts of the provincial capital of kunming the member herd has been caught at night trotting down urban streets by security cameras filmed constantly from the air by more than a dozen drones and followed by those seeking to minimize damage and keep both pachyderms and people out of harm s way while no animals or people have been hurt reports put damage to crops at more than million sixteen animals were originally in the group but the government says two returned home and a baby was born during the walk the herd is now composed of six female and three male adults three juveniles and three calves according to official reports what exactly motivated them to make the epic journey remains a mystery although they appear to be especially attracted to corn tropical fruit and other crops that are tasty plentiful and easy to obtain in the lush tropical region that is home to about of the animals others have speculated their leader may be simply lost asian elephants are loyal to their home ranges unless there have been disturbances loss of resources or development in which case they may move out according to nilanga jayasinghe manager for asian species conservation at the world wildlife fund in this case we do n t really know why they left their home range but do know that there has been significant habitat loss due to agriculture and conversion of forests into plantations within that range in the last few decades jayasinghe wrote in an email what possibly happened here is that in their search for new habitat they got lost along the way and kept going authorities have been working to avoid negative interactions and must determine what the best next steps here are and keep human elephant conflict at bay jayasinghe wrote kunming is to host the upcoming convention on biological diversity s convention of parties to discuss topics such as human wildlife conflict and this is a real time example of the importance of addressing the issue and its root causes for the benefit of both wildlife and people she wrote elephants are given the top level of protection in china allowing their numbers to steadily increase even as their natural habitat shrinks and requiring farmers and others to exercise maximum restraint when encountering them government orders have told people to stay inside and not to gawk at them or use firecrackers or otherwise attempt to scare them away so far more passive means are being used to keep them out of urban areas including the parking of trucks and construction equipment to block roads and the use of food drops to lure them away as of tuesday the herd remained on the outskirts of kunming a city of million with one of the males having moved away on his own creating even more excitement and worry for those attempting to keep tabs on them a statement monday from a provincial command center set up to monitor the group said the elephants appeared to be resting while more than emergency response personnel and police personnel scores of vehicles and drones were deployed to monitor them area residents were evacuated temporary traffic control measures implemented and tons of elephant food put in place another objective was to maintain silence to create conditions for guiding the elephant group to migrate west and south the command center said asian elephants the continent s largest land animal are declining overall with

environmental,mountain lions are known for being stealthy predators but they re also good at escaping detection while at rest most of the time the us fish and wildlife service posted a peaceful

applications pacific southwest region for usfws a wildlife conservation scientist in nevada took this picture in washoe county prompting the us fish and wildlife service to ask people to see if their eyes were sharp enough to spot the hidden mountain lion given the animal s tawny coat its easy to assume that the mountain lion must be hiding somewhere on top of the rocks where the yellowed grass and weeds are surrounding it but upon closer look it turns out the animal is actually staying out of the sun and hiding under the boulder usfws facebook visitors had a ball trying to spot the hidden mountain lion that little stinker is hiding in the little cave wrote one facebook user what amazing animals they are wrote another who spotted the hidden mountain lion a mountain lion also known as a cougar or a puma is seen running through the snow its distinctive facial markings helped reveal its location in the where s waldo image file image facebook users were quick to spot the hidden mountain lion in the shadows under the boulders but some admitted they never would ve seen the animal if they hadn t known to look for it but not everyone found it so easy to find the hidden big cat in the

new england style stone wall so i missed it at first those rocks are huge a facebook user admitted you led us to the water and told us it was wet how many of us would have spotted the cat without prompting wondered another cat spotter male mountain lions can grow to be as long as eight feet from nose to tail with shoulders as wide as inches while females tend to between three to four inches shorter in height and inches shorter in length the nevada department of wildlife says an average male mountain lion in nevada is said to weigh about pounds while a female weights pounds mountain lions have been found to weigh up to pounds although its rare the wildlife agency said the agency noted that mountain lions prefer dense cover or rocky rugged terrain but also occur in desert areas and that two of the most important components of lion habitat are a source of meat and cover for in a pamphlet the agency noted that people rarely get more than a brief glimpse of a mountain lion in the wild and that it s rare for the solitary animals to attack people there have been fewer than a dozen fatalities in north america in more than years involving attacks by mountain lions often young lions forced to hunt on their own without living in an established area people hiking where mountain lions live are urged to make lots of noise to avoid startling the creatures not to approach them and to back away slowly rather than run which could trigger a chase if the mountain lion approaches people shouldn t crouch or bend down but instead try to appear bigger and throw things at them small children should also be picked up off the ground and if necessary people should fight back while remaining upright as mountain lions have been known to be scared away by prey that way,mountain known

health,ontario s chief medical officer of health says some critics do n t understand the challenges toronto on the eve of his retirement as ontario s top doctor david williams says the effort to control the covid pandemic has gone better than he had expected i think it s gone quite well dr williams said in an interview tuesday with tbnewswatch he retires on friday from the post of chief medical officer of health several months after his five year appointment in february was scheduled to expire williams will be succeeded by dr kieran moore currently the medical officer of health for the kingston area his legacy of public service includes years as medical officer of health for the thunder bay district health unit during two separate terms starting in during the pandemic some critics have faulted him for his communication style and for not pushing the government to impose stronger restrictions in advance of an upsurge in covid cases earlier this year the head of the registered nurses association of ontario was particularly harsh charging that williams lacked foresight at the outset and appeared incapable of standing up to premier ford as part of her critique of the provincial government s handling of the crisis last november auditor general bonnie lysyk also suggested williams had not led the response williams defended the job he s done saying some people do n t understand the challenges the pandemic presented for ontario when you try to compare ontario to any other province you ca n t do the comparison he said he cited the province s sheer size and multicultural diversity as unique factors in dealing with a public health crisis having nearly million people and a centre like the greater toronto area that normally has almost people coming in internationally every day even during the pandemic we dropped down to people a day other provinces dropped down to nearly nothing williams noted that the infection and death rates in ontario were far lower than other jurisdictions such as in the which he credited largely to teamwork within the public health network and to the abundance of experts that no other province has while acknowledging that people are hurting in many ways and not just from covid he said that for a lot of ontarians it s been disrupted but it has n t been a dismantling they have been able to work around it for some it s been almost like a nuisance rather than a crisis we ve come out a lot better than i anticipated williams says he pointed to the province s pandemic plan which projected that a minimum of to per cent of the population would test positive that means instead of cases we should have by now million to million people positive and three per cent of those are going to die we have n t had anywhere near those kinds of numbers williams suggested that his handful of critics have tended to say the same things again and again sometimes getting personal which he described as unprofessional on their part that s far outweighed by all the positive commentary i get their commentary about the lack of communication i am overwhelmed by the number of emails i get about how much they appreciate the clear concise and consistent communication that i ve undertaken over the last year and a half it s totally opposite of what these critics would like to comment on people are allowed to have a difference of opinion as long as they have something to back it up i found that a lot of the assertions lacked detail and numbers but at the same time i listened to them williams added that there may be six or seven people that do n t feel great about how he s handled the pandemic but there are or others whom he is consulting all the time and who have positive input i do n t get too worried about that aspect i think they have to assess their own performance and see what they did because in a pandemic and crisis if you re not with the program then you re against the program it s better to be at the table and contribute with suggestions he maintained that his style of leadership has enabled him to win the strong respect of premier ford and his cabinet most of the time my advice was widely taken seriously williams said even when the premier said at times this is going to be tough decision one of the hardest ones to make but i understand where you re coming from and i ll go out and say it he believes that when the pandemic is over ontario may reflect further on the risk of being so dependent on foreign suppliers for critical items williams said what bothered him the most during the pandemic was those occasions when resources were not available particularly vaccine supplies but in a global reality some things are under your control some things are not under your control he s pleased though with the current covid vaccination rate of about per cent to date particularly in comparison with historical flu vaccine rates which he said have never exceeded per cent of the population williams also said vaccines for children aged five to may be available this fall he expects that by late summer ontario will return to a new normal in which covid will be in the background rather than the foreground albeit with the awareness that new strains of the virus may continue to pose a challenge i think we re in a very good position he said but the public is much more alert to the risks of infectious diseases i think people will be less likely to congregate in large crowds for a period of time at least williams plans to take some time off to enjoy his retirement with his children and grandchildren and work on improvements at his summer cottage as he told his wife this is the first time in years he wo n t be on call ultimately williams hopes to return to nepal to visit a hospital he worked at for years earlier in his career but covid wo n t let go of him quite yet as he needs to participate in some internal reviews of ontario s response to the pandemic starting in

science,the end of the covid pandemic is still a long way away however it is already a good time to reflect on how we have tried to maintain a vibrant research community we have all been forced to adapt to the unusual circumstances of the past months researchers have managed to maintain productivity at least if the number of submissions that nature plants have received is anything to go by this has been achieved in part by adopting creative ways to do remotely what was previously done in person some of these ideas have proven so successful that they deserve to become permanent fixtures of the life scientific others that were commonplace and thought essential before have been so easily replaced that they may never return despite additional security and safety measures performing experimental work has not substantially changed the culture of the laboratory will hopefully return as well meetings held on programmes such as zoom or teams are functional but a poor substitute for an in person coffee and cake session most researchers will be missing the regular gatherings that pull a laboratory together and make it more than the sum of its members similarly there is an activation energy required for instant messaging that is not present when sharing an office with colleagues colleagues who may unexpectedly have the answer to the problem you are struggling over lectures and seminars have also been moved online in early this mostly entailed the speaker sharing their screen with attendees and delivering their standard script however online talks have developed they do not have to be live but can be pre recorded removing the problems of recalcitrant technology and unreliable internet connections this allows lecturers to ensure that their presentations appear exactly as intended and fit within their allotted time slot technically minded individuals can seamlessly integrate all sorts of media a live question session can still follow but written questions submitted through a chat window are easier to moderate these are excellent developments that were already happening to some degree before covid accelerated their adoption another advantage is that these recordings can be made available for consumption at a later date increasing their reach to anyone interested at any time it seems very likely that the pre recorded lecture will become much more common or even the norm this is an obvious advantage to lecturers especially for undergraduate teaching if a presentation can be recorded it can be reused for research lectures this may not be particularly helpful as there is a desire to include the most up to date results even if of the story has been told before however undergraduate lectures do not change much from year to year the same recording of introduction to plant genetics can be rereleased each year this idea is seductive but has its downsides even basic lectures will become stale and out of date quite quickly and it is far from easy to ignite a student s interest without the personal experience of an expert s enthusiasm of course lectures that have been recorded for one university can be easily used at other schools there are already companies that sell recordings of great courses of lectures delivered over the internet these seem to be primarily aimed at the amateur infotainment seeking user but this business model could be easily adapted if so freed from the need for a balanced range of expertise available universities may start over specializing in particular subjects or even decide that they do not need as many experienced staff a threat to the continued health of less charismatic research areas including many aspects of plant biology two members of the nature plants editorial team are based in china and are currently making the rest of us jealous by their ability to attend conferences and visit research institutes in person for the rest of us meetings great and small have had to be virtual affairs even when it is again possible to fill lecture halls with delegates the emergence of new variants of the sars cov virus will make international travel less straightforward than pre pandemic virtual conferences or at least conferences with a virtual component are here to stay the time saved in not travelling to attend in person will be very welcome and we are all well aware that fewer journeys by plane will be a help in addressing climate change but other important aspects will be lost despite the internet s undoubted ability to connect people across continents it is not a good venue for serendipity the chance encounters that take place during coffee breaks or lunches on shuttle buses or while hanging around the conference venue are very difficult to reproduce virtually it is exactly these fortuitous meetings that can lead to the unexpected collaborations and research approaches that drive science forward as editors we particularly value these less formal conversations this is where researchers will talk freely about the experiments they have not yet completed we can learn about alliances and collaborations that could affect the effectiveness of the peer review process and meet early career researchers often long before we see or publish their papers as a consequence the most important part of a conference for an editor is probably the poster sessions sadly the poster session experience has proven to be highly unsatisfactory when reproduced virtually displaying a poster online is easy enough but in a remote environment these have to be actively sought by scanning through a list of titles and abstracts perhaps there should be a random shuffle for virtual poster sessions but i haven t yet seen any conference employing one it must also be a dispiriting experience for the poster presenter waiting in an empty chat room hoping that someone will join them when they do it tends to be to ask very specific questions that fail to develop into a discussion you can t even chat to the person with the poster next to you scientific research has managed to weather this pandemic relatively well and some of the new ways of working have positive advantages that will continue far into the future however the essence of our community forged through shared experiences is threatened if too many of our interactions continue to be online or maybe i just can t wait

so i said that in court piara whose father anis mridha passed away before the incident told the daily star that her family had a dispute with her uncle ziaul haque over land piara s elder brother yunus mridha was out of the picture as he was working as a mason in the capital then when ziaul s seven or eight year old daughter died in he conspired so that piara said in court what the police official had taught her she was then taken to pirojpur district jail piara could not remember the name of the police official local administration and this correspondent tried to reach ziaul but could not because he lives in a remote area deputy inspector general of police barishal range sm akhtaruzzaman said we have heard of this incident if there was any police role behind it no apology would be

drought conditions described as moderate or worse according to data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in northern illinois conditions are abnormally dry a moderate drought or a severe drought depending on where exactly you live according to the national drought mitigation center temperatures were well above normal in our area and very little rain fell at all over the week there was a slight expansion of abnormally dry and moderate drought conditions over northern illinois due to the weather nationally nearly percent of the united states was experiencing some type of drought for the week ending june according to the latest noaa data in addition to million people more than million acres of crops are being affected by the dry conditions last week rain brought respite to much of the great plains however as extreme heat moves into the dry west and northern plains noaa forecasters warn that drought may intensify meanwhile in the southeast dryness and drought have been steadily spreading in virginia the carolinas and florida the worst areas of drought are in southwest states where parts of california nevada arizona new mexico utah and colorado are experiencing extreme or exceptionally severe drought conditions according to the national drought mitigation center drought is defined as a lack of precipitation such as rain snow or sleet over a period that typically results in a water shortage while drought usually stems from an area s specific weather pattern it can also be triggered by human activity such as water use and management behind hurricanes drought is the second most costly form of natural disaster in the united states exacting an average toll of billion in damage and loss per event according to statistics from the national centers for environmental information usually some level of drought has some part of the country in its grip during the historic dry spell of the nation s most extensive since the s as much as two thirds of the country was affected by drought at its peak droughts can sometimes last longer than a season from to scant rainfall and record breaking heat in california created what is estimated to have been the state s worst drought in years according to the national resources defense council fortunately for everyone water is a renewable resource that moves in a cycle with neither a beginning nor an end typically the united states receives enough precipitation during an average year to cover the states in a depth of about inches but when it does rain what happens to water when it reaches the ground about percent of the annual precipitation returns to the atmosphere by evaporation from land and water surfaces and by vapor from vegetation the remaining percent eventually reaches a stream lake or ocean due to runoff during and immediately after rain as well as soaking into the ground if you ve ever wondered where a raindrop ends up when it falls in illinois check out this

social,photo steveallenphoto istock getty images plus on june texas governor greg abbott signed legislation that would almost completely ban abortions in the state should the supreme court ever invalidate the roe v wade decision which allows for abortion in the united states house bill also known as the human life protection act will take effect if the supreme court wholly or partly overrules roe v wade or if a constitutional amendment ever allows states to ban abortions the law is what is known as a trigger bill and would go into effect days after a ruling invalidating roe v wade or constitutional amendment allowing abortion bans triggers the new law exceptions are in place if there are risks to the mother s life or if there could be a substantial impairment of major bodily function the new law would make it a second degree felony to attempt to perform an abortion if the abortion is successful and the baby dies the penalty would rise to a first degree felony which could potentially lead to a life sentence besides the possible jail time abortionists could lose any medical license they might have and be subject to fines of up to women who seek abortions are immune from prosecution under the terms of the law since a constitutional amendment allowing states to ban abortion seems unlikely the most likely way for the bill to become law is if the supreme court invalidates all or part of roe v in may the high court agreed to hear the case of dobbs v jackson women s health organization that case involves a mississippi law which forbids abortion after weeks gestation wade is at the heart of the case and all or parts of it could be overturned many court watchers consider dobbs v jackson women s health organization a direct challenge to roe v a favorable ruling would make texas one of the first states to end abortions the bill s author state rep giovanni capriglione r tarrant county said pro life advocates were predictibly happy with the new law we are extremely pleased at the passage of hb said dr joe pojman executive director of texas alliance for life when the legislation was passed in may to whatever extent the supreme court allows states to protect unborn babies from abortion whether at weeks six weeks or at conception the human life protection act will go into effect to the same extent the passage of the human life protection act is especially significant in light of the recent announcement of the united states supreme court to consider the dobbs v jackson women s health organization case pojman said pro abortion forces were typically outraged by abbott s signature on the bill hb is different from and more extreme than most trigger bans and goes against the majority of texans support for safe legal abortion the bill would allow a total abortion ban to go into effect in texas if the supreme court partly overruled roe or if the court partly gave the state the authority to prohibit abortion said dyana limon mercado the executive director of planned parenthood texas votes in a statement limon mercado chastised the state legislature for focusing on abortion instead of other problems in the state saying members of the texas legislature prioritized abortion bans attacks on trans kids permitless carry and voter suppression bills the people of texas deserve better abbott and the texas legislature have been busy on the abortion front having signed the texas heartbeat act in may which effectively bans abortions in the state as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected which is often as early as four weeks into a pregnancy that law is set to take effect at the beginning of september although the bill is expected to face multiple legal challenges prior to its implementation in addition to the state of texas taking action on abortion several localities in the state including lubbock a city of residents have acted to curtail abortion within their city limits lubbock has declared itself a sanctuary city for the unborn with the federal government currently held hostage by far left ideologues this is how the fight against the killing of the unborn looks for the time being yet there is a game changer stratagem that the pro life movement could start employing in a big way in its decades long fight to end the barbarism of abortion that stratagem is for states to recognize that roe v wade is an unconstitutional overreach on the part of the supreme court and to declare roe unconstitutional within their state borders on the basis of nullification a report by the pro abortion guttmacher institue released in april shows the palpable angst among the pro abortion crowd is on track to become the most devastating anti abortion state legislative session in decades said elizabeth nash and

health,cambridge mass paragonix technologies inc today announces the launch of its clinical global registry guardian lung global utilization and registry database for improved preservation of donor lungs the guardian lung study is unlike any lung donation registry as it seeks to evaluate a missing piece of the organ donation process the impact of methods and technologies used for lung preservation and transportation on the success of transplant surgery the clinical study is registered at and is open to all lung transplant centers that are looking to analyze patient outcomes based on donor lung preservation methods clinical investigators from the enrolling centers will pool their data and analyze the differences in clinical outcomes of patients who receive donor lungs preserved either in the paragonix lungguard donor lung preservation system or with traditional methods of storing in a consumer cooler on ice the study will focus on short term post transplant outcomes within the first hours intermediate term outcomes within the first days and long term outcomes year survival all programs should be seeking the opportunity to participate and contribute to this study paragonix has previously found that preservation method does positively impact a patient s stay in the icu the guardian lung study follows the success of paragonix s first registry guardian for evaluating donor heart preservation comparing historic ice storage to the paragonix sherpapak cardiac transport system in a recently presented multi center clinical study investigators found that the donor hearts preserved by the paragonix sherpapak system had statistically significant increases in total ischemic time and travel distance meaning the organ was able to be effectively preserved outside a human body longer and be retrieved from donors at a greater distance from the recipient an analysis of the patients with extended ischemic times found the portion of patients in the icu for two weeks or more was reduced by percent in the paragonix sherpapak cohort and the portion of patients in the icu for only a week or less was increased by more than double with the paragonix system compared to ice transplant surgery presents many unknowns and complexities we ve invested in these studies to better support the transplant teams and patients by providing insights that may help them in handling the dynamics of the entire operation from transport to transplant said lisa anderson ceo of paragonix technologies the first results of our guardian registry for heart preservation and transplantation sets an exciting and optimistic stage for what we can achieve for further supporting lung preservation and transplantation the importance of both the heart and lung registries is clear to transplant teams around the world the more data we have on the variables of the entire transplant process the more lives we can potentially save said errol bush md surgical director advanced lung disease and lung transplant program and associate professor of surgery at johns hopkins medicine insights gathered from the initial heart registry not only inform new approaches to organ preservation but show that preservation could be crucial in overcoming other considerations of the transplant procedure that may be challenging such as donor and recipient characteristics the lungguard system provides a highly controlled environment for hypothermic lung preservation coupled with real time digital monitoring to safeguard donor lungs throughout the entire transport journey via the paragonix app where historically communication and coordination has been difficult paragonix s centralized communication and data transfer capabilities are fully compatible with and integrated into the usage of the lungguard system this system is based on the same architecture as the award winning paragonix sherpapak system that has successfully transported over donor hearts since clinical launch in the guardian studies are the only and largest registries focused on donor organ preservation paragonix is committed to understanding the science of organ preservation investing in the research to understand the impact of devices such as its sherpapak cardiac transport system and lungguard donor lung procurement system about paragonix technologies paragonix technologies markets organ transportation devices that safeguard organs during the journey between donor and recipient patients our devices incorporate clinically proven and medically trusted cold preservation techniques in a

under pandemic restrictions after being closed last year campers and staff will be kept in pods of or less wear masks outside their sleeping quarters and eat outdoors to prevent outbreaks ap overnight summer camps will be allowed in all states this season but covid rules and a pandemic labor crunch mean that many fewer young campers will attend and those who do will have to observe coronavirus precautions for the second consecutive year the southeast is the first region to kick off camps this month with other parts of the country to follow in july camp might look a little different but camp is going to look a lot better in than it did in when it didn t happen said matt norman of atlanta who is getting ready to send his year old daughter to camp even though most camps will be open reduced capacity necessitated by covid restrictions and the labor shortage will keep numbers well below a normal threshold of about million summer campers said tom rosenberg of the american camp association across the country many camps face competition for counselors in a tight job market traditional recruitment tactics like job fairs on college campuses have been canceled it s been hard to get people to work said josh nelson at glorieta adventure camp a facility in pine covered foothills outside santa fe new mexico a group of glorieta camp staffers started their orientation by rolling up their sleeves and getting vaccinated in an area between the mess hall and the water slides but many campers are too young to get the shots because the vaccines have not been approved for children under that means this year s camp experience will still involve many of the same prevention practices that were adopted at the small number of camps that operated last year those measures include grouping kids in cohorts mandating masks emphasizing social distancing and lots of hand washing some states like vermont are offering free virus testing for campers at an all girls camp called fernwood in maine about of the counselors and campers will be vaccinated by the time the six week term starts going into it it s a much better scenario for us because instead of being worried about people we re worried about people fernwood director fritz seving said norman plans to send daughter jane ellen to camp illahee in brevard north carolina and he s glad the camp is encouraging vaccinations jane ellen agreed and said the focus on vaccines is a good idea back at glorieta staff arrived in may from oklahoma texas and a college town in mexico called puebla where an in person recruiting fair took place they have been training on safety protocols including virus protection zip lining and life guarding the camp is running at one third capacity out of slots are filled and staff will be grouped in pods kids are expected to wear masks even outdoors except when the are eating meals or in their sleeping dorm more than of the staff agreed to be vaccinated but there was no mandate for vaccinations even with those limitations the outlook is much better than last year when camp was canceled and of the staff was laid off by march nelson said federal paycheck protection program loans helped but didn t alleviate all of the financial pain he said rosenberg said camp is more important than ever in terms of providing normalcy for kids who have dealt with remote learning canceled events and boredom at home not to mention health worries camp will let them practice engaging peer to peer and offer a chance to to try new activities take positive risks and be out in nature and sort of regain some of the humanity they ve lost over the past year last year about million kids missed out on camp but most of the overnight camps that opened operated successfully more than people were infected at a camp in

education,minneapolis ap a new student group in the university of minnesota school of dentistry is looking to continue the effort to advance diversity equity and inclusion in the school the group better together hosted its first event on may exactly one year after george floyd was murdered in minneapolis arpun johal a third year student in the school and one of the group s founding members said floyd s murder prompted the group s formation last year i feel that many people did a lot of reflection about racism and the political climate in the johal said from that we noticed that there was a lot of work to be done in our own careers to help with the larger civil rights movement the group s first meeting covered recent hate crimes against asian americans and pacific islanders anti asian racism the experiences of asian dental students at the university and how to become a better ally to asian students and patients the minnesota daily reported since may hate crimes against asians in of the country s largest cities and counties are up according to the center for the study of hate and extremism at cal state university san bernardino new york city saw the largest increase in such reported crimes against asians with a spike in early johal said it was important to cover this topic at the first meeting given the spike in hate crimes and anti asian sentiment in the country we wanted to capture the moment and have these discussions when the whole country had just experienced these events johal said the concepts are more likely to hit home if the topic is fresh people are still thinking about it and are more likely to take action zayna jan another third year student and founding member of better together created a toolkit for bystander intervention that students can review and utilize i wanted the toolkit to be something that people can look at easily and understand quickly and for it to be dental school specific jan said giving students the ability to share their stories has already been effective incidents of racism are often suppressed by students of color and thus these situations can go unnoticed by the majority of dental students she added education and open discussion is the first step and we are trying to get people involved and just listen jan said whether people acknowledge them or not these things affect the way people treat their patients it does affect the line of work that we do and i hope that sparks something in people dr naty lopez is a professor in the school and is the assistant dean for admissions and diversity equity and inclusion lopez applauded student efforts over the past year and said she looks forward to continuing the conversations what has been so important about this last year is that we have responded to the current events as a grassroots movement instead of a top down approach lopez said students were not just satisfied with learning about bias and discrimination they wanted to be prepared as future health care professionals to work with a diverse patient population as of spring students pursuing a doctor of dental surgery were white the next largest racial group was asians at while black and hispanic students made up around of the student body respectively lopez said that the dental school is not yet where it wants to be in terms of structural diversity within the school many of the patients receiving care in the university dental clinics are from marginalized backgrounds having a student body that is more reflective of that patient population is difficult because of the cost and extra preparation necessary for students to reach dental school lopez said the projected four year cost of attendance at the school for non minnesota residents graduating in is almost for minnesota residents it is just under along with other students jan said it was conflicting to ask the dental school to admit more students of color because they believe the current environment and culture would not be entirely beneficial for those students why would you put more students of color into an environment that they are not safe in or are not going to thrive in better together wants to host at least one monthly meeting going forward jan said lopez said she believes the dental school s students faculty and staff have turned the last year into an opportunity for positive change you can see the coming together of different groups and i think that is the key for the school to believe and think that this is our work not just the work of one group she said with the advent of juneteenth johal said better together hopes to cover topics relating to the black community in the coming month we want to continue to provide space for students to be able to share their experiences she said,new student group university school dentistry looking continue effort advance diversity equity inclusion school group better together first event may exactly one year george floyd third year

labour,handout cornwall standard freeholder postmedia network sketch of the design of the morrisburg roundabout released by the united counties of sdg in october and since revised sdg council voted to move ahead with the morrisburg roundabout and streetscaping project on monday after considering a new bid that was million lower than one received in december council awarded the contract to coco paving inc headquartered in toronto but with nine sites across cornwall and sdg including an office in morrisburg at a cost of some million of the work comes from the sdg budget with million from federal provincial infrastructure funding and the balance from the municipality of south dundas council s authorization will allow sdg staff members to meet with coco as soon as possible in order to get the construction work started right away the project includes the replacement of the intersection of county roads and with a roundabout as well as reconstructing county road between st lawrence street and laurier drive the new bid though lower than the one council balked at in december is still budgeted to come in at over the million sdg placed in the then the budget in order to pay for the county s share of the work the recommendation placed before council monday was to cover this shortfall from the expected surplus in hot mix paving for but transportation and planning services director ben de haan told council the final overage may not come in that high that includes some contingencies that are likely not going to be incurred but there are all sorts of project contingencies accounted for in that shortfall de haan said it s a reasonable overall picture of what it will look like for us we re confident the contractor is willing to work with us to lower costs further this is their home too and they have great interest de haan noted some possible items that may not end up being needed are line items like temporary asphalt which is included in case a stretch of the project goes too long as gravel dirt increased use of water or other dust suppressant could reduce or eliminate that need similarly there s a contingency for managing contaminated soils which if any is found while the work is being completed has to be dealt with appropriately but none is expected morrisburg roundabout bids come in million over budget a roundabout discussion regarding big changes coming to morrisburg final design for morrisburg roundabout finalized the bid was reworked from december to eliminate some items which led to the million drop in costs these included trimming back on some pedestrian elements converting storm sewers into open ditches and trimmed back on the planned landscaping councillors were supportive of moving forward but questioned whether using the expected surplus in the roads department s hot mix paving program to cover this shortfall was the appropriate solution steven byvelds pointed out council only recently approved a policy to place this exact surplus into a reserve fund to help address road repairs on other county roads that need work but haven t reached the point where they are put forward for reconstruction i know we have the extra money there however we re trying to save those dollars for those roads we ve ignored forever and we all know the list byvelds said sdg treasurer rebecca russell noted the county expects a million balance in its working reserve once the financials are finalized and a balance of million is expected in the road resurfacing reserve she reminder members it would be council s decision on which reserve to take the over budget amount from once those bills were due bryan mcgillis suggested rather than hash out this detail now council could just request a report from staff members on alternate sources to pay the shortfall south dundas council was to meet monday night to discuss the new bid given it too will have to commit to the new amount that comes over the budget it set for its part of the

science,north american sushi nomenclature evoked locations effects shape or colour then there s the crazy boy roll in the long running annual series oh the humanities national post reporters survey academic scholarship at the congress of the humanities and social sciences which has gone entirely virtual this year hosted at the university of alberta from may to june the california roll has disputed origin stories one has it starting in vancouver in the late s with the state s abbreviation ca serendipitously standing for the roll s main ingredients crab and avocado another places the invention in los angeles where squeamish diners trying a newly stylish foreign cuisine preferred not to see the seaweed wrapping of the traditional japanese preparation so the makizushi literally rolled sushi was served inside out showing rice with avocado standing in for raw tuna in the fish s off season however it began it took off like pepperoni pizza and according to the new research of kiyoko toratani of york university s department of languages literatures and linguistics the california roll s name became a template for the naming of rolls as north american sushi came into its own her theory is that the california roll was the primary example of a broader trend in japan sushi rolls are named literally for the ingredients but the north american sushi menu has become wildly figurative and metaphorical from the spider roll to the skydome roll and even the ex boyfriend roll read more oh the humanities stories everything else is secondary the social history of shawarma poutine to study this toratani classified the menu offerings of leading sushi restaurants in san diego houston and toronto for a presentation to the canadian society for the study of names at the annual congress of the humanities and social sciences i was amazed by the uniqueness of their names and images because they were so different from the japanese original she said monday in an interview she explained this by reference to metonymy the linguistic concept in which one word stands for another related word as when people use the crown to refer to the monarchy her argument is that california is an example of metonymy for avocado in which the place name stands in for the ingredient this type of place for product metonymy became the standard menu pitch as the notion spread to include the boston roll with shrimp or the new orleans roll with crawfish a spider roll made with deep fried soft shell crab this template also shows up in a double metonymy such as the amigo roll which evokes mexico which in turn evokes the main ingredient avocado or the cajun roll suggesting louisiana and therefore the main ingredient oysters this was the most common naming convention variations include an effect for product metonymy such as the energy roll reflecting the japanese idea that eel restores energy next common was a description of shape or colour as in caterpillar spider dragon or rainbow roll which look figuratively like their names some referred to the diner such as the salmon lover s roll or the shrimp killer roll one thing that stands out is how few of these names are japanese toratani has previously studied the process by which the word sushi was naturalized into north american english first explained with a paraphrase as in sushi or rice sandwiches second as a compound element to describe a sushi bar or sushi restaurant and finally with a shift in meaning to refer more broadly to raw fish rather than the literal japanese dish with vinegared rice for this newest work that describes the california roll as the prototypical maki name toratani surveyed the various menus and noted that almost per cent of the names were words from outside the restaurant context dragon rolls presented in the shape of a writhing dragon so although some rolls were named with familiar menu words such as crunchy spicy or grilled many evoked stereotypical japanese notions in the north american imagination that have nothing to do with food such as the kamikaze roll sumo roll and hot geisha roll the lion king roll is arguably somehow kenyan and the star wars roll seems even more distant from its culinary roots nature s wonders figured prominently like tornado and magma rolls as did sex from hot night roll and s m roll to the french kiss roll these names remind us that north american sushi rolls were born in restaurants as many of them adopt naming strategies for the purpose of getting the diner s attention toratani said this contrasts starkly with japanese naming conventions which rely on the literal ingredient and as toratani explained carry the implication of home cookery we don t have to sell the sushi roll that s why we just use the ingredient for the name she said the california roll was a product of north american chefs having to pitch an unfamiliar concept in which the literal description was less effective than the figurative it caught on so well that it started to change the cuisine itself i think this sushi roll has a life of its own that s just evolving continuously toratani said noting that some menus now list an option in which a california roll is deep fried called a crazy boy roll for japanese frying sushi is just crazy she said,north american nomenclature effect shape colour crazy boy

weather,two washington electric utilities buffeted by serious power line fires during last september s windstorms have opted not to develop plans for public safety power shut offs that could be used to prevent the ignition of such blazes during those windstorms a fire started by a sparking avista corp line destroyed homes in the malden area of eastern washington others that flared in western washington destroyed seven homes in an area of pierce county served by puget sound energy during a may public meeting convened by the state utilities and transportation commission officials with the two utilities outlined a range of measures for the season that includes surveillance to spot hazard trees pole replacement and maintenance to keep branches off lines the officials said the fire prevention measures currently in place should be enough to reduce the risks currently public safety power shut off is not in our tool kit said dave james who manages avista s wildfire resiliency program dan koch pse s vice president of operations said the majority of the utility s service territory lies in low to moderate risk wildfire areas and the company is hardening lines in the higher risk areas to make fires less likely at least for now the company is not considering public safety power shutdowns in oregon and california all the investor owned utilities regulated by state utility commissions have developed such plans as has the portland based bonneville power administration which operates a regional northwest transmission network these plans map out strategies during times of extreme risk to preemptively de energize lines so they won t spark if they are blown down or struck by trees these actions are controversial since they can leave customers without power for days on end but have taken on increased importance as power line ignitions have been found to be the cause of some of the region s worst fires in oregon the state public utility commission informally requested in that all three of the state s regulated power companies develop these plans and earlier this month the commission issued temporary rules to regulate how they are carried out according to kandi young a commission spokeswoman so far washington s utilities and transportation commission has chosen not to require the three regulated power companies to develop public safety power cutoff plans and only one of these utilities pacific power pacificorp has opted to adapt one for service areas prone to wildfires at the may meeting the washington commission chair praised the preparations of the state s investor owned power utilities i know that in other states their commissions are actually developing rules doing a little more of what i would call maybe this is the wrong word micromanaging said david danner chair of the washington utilities and transportation commission but their involvement is certainly getting more significant so we will be having conversations about what ours should be in a statement released after the meeting a utility spokesperson said the commission has not proposed one size fits all rules as it expects the utilities to fulfill their requirements to provide safe and reliable service in washington last year weather forecasts in early september predicted extreme fire risk amid hot temperatures low humidity and strong east winds at least blazes were started by power lines according to a seattle times analysis of data from the department of natural resources and other sources as well as interviews with fire officials in whitman and pierce counties the most damaging fire erupted in the avista service area after a treetop from outside the utility s right of way fell on a line sparks ignited brush then winds created walls of flame that races across fields toward malden whitman county avista officials say that in they have a robust plan that is appropriate for our service territory to prevent power line fires according to a statement from a company spokesperson this plan includes an expanded effort to identify and remove trees that might fall on lines and a technology that can be put into place that limits the automatic reclosing of circuits when there is a disturbance on the line such as a blown fuse if the circuits are not reclosed then power is shut off to the area downstream from the disturbance until the area can be inspected though it doesn t make fire ignition risk zero it is the lowest we can possibly achieve without preemptively de energizing a circuit james said at the meeting pacificorp however has taken a different approach developing a public safety power shutdown as a last ditch option during extreme weather in an area northwest of yakima as well as areas in oregon and california where it provides service at the may public hearing a pacific power official said he did not anticipate the utility having to use the option this year in washington but it is part of the tool kit we are prepared to do it if it gets there said allen berreth pacific power s vice president of operations in oregon pacific power lines run through some of the areas hardest hit by september wildfires in an area east of salem the company had a plan in place for public safety power shutdowns and now is a defendant in lawsuits that cite the failure to cut off the electricity as evidence of negligence in a statement last fall drew hanson a pacificorp spokesperson said the company does not discuss pending litigation we continue to work alongside our own third party investigators to fully understand the impact of one of the biggest and far reaching windstorms we ve seen in our year history hanson said,two washington electric serious power line last september develop public safety power shut could

politics,midlands voices these immigration proposals deserve support from fischer sasse we all like to think of our state as unique and in a lot of ways nebraska truly is founded in our state has a proud history of working the land building relationships helping neighbors and welcoming strangers all of which make it different but nebraska is not unique in the benefits it derives from immigrants and i m calling on sens deb fisher and ben sasse to stand up for our state and our nation in support of two bills that have already passed in the house the american dream and promise act and the farm workforce modernization act we sent our senators to congress to act in the best interests of nebraskans and these bills will do exactly that passing the american dream and promise act and the farm workforce modernization act will strengthen our state s families and economy and live up to our values by providing a pathway to citizenship for dreamers young people who came or were brought to the united states as children as well as recipients of temporary protected status tps and deferred enforced departure ded who are nationals of countries that were designated for protection due to environmental disaster or civil conflict the american dream and promise act would offer a sense of safety and security to folks who have been productive members of our local and national economy often for decades there is not currently a way for them to get citizenship but there should be the other bill the farm workforce modernization act would offer a pathway to citizenship for undocumented agricultural workers revise the h a agricultural worker program and impose mandatory employment verification through the e verify program in agriculture these improvements would stabilize the farm labor force and ensure greater food safety and security for the country during the pandemic it became incredibly clear how essential frontline workers truly are and nothing is more frontline than our fields and farms where our food comes from farmers businesses and worker organizations agree on this bill it is a huge step forward for nebraska and the nation as a whole i have worked as an immigration attorney in omaha for over years and i know firsthand how important immigrants are to our local and state economy immigrants are a critical component of the nebraskan labor force according to the american immigration council of the state s life physical and social science professionals are immigrants as are of nebraskans working in production occupations immigrant led households in nebraska paid million in federal taxes and million in state and local taxes in immigrants are our neighbors business owners taxpayers and co workers who are an integral part of nebraska s diverse and thriving communities and make extensive contributions that benefit all but beyond that i also know that americans overwhelmingly support providing permanent legal status and a path to citizenship for unauthorized people who have made this country their home and are working hard and contributing to its prosperity and safety during the covid pandemic two thirds of americans favor allowing all unauthorized immigrants to obtain legal status and apply for citizenship and even more of them support dreamers and agricultural workers receiving citizenship fisher and sasse to understand that we want immigration solutions that unite and serve our state and national interest sure i would like to see even more reforms since our immigration laws have not been updated in more than a generation but success on these bills is a step in the right direction that will build momentum for congress to take further strides to modernize the rest of our immigration system giving us a smart workable plan forward mark j curley is the managing partner at an omaha law firm specializing in immigration law he and his team have been assisting employers immigrants and families with immigration matters

social,a thayer father will spend time in prison after admitting he was high on heroin while his two young sons drowned in the kankakee river eric patillo was sentenced to years in the indiana department of corrections on wednesday judge samuel cappas ordered him into a month drug rehab program if he completes it the judge could revise his sentence but he did not guarantee it would be changed patillo signed a plea agreement april dropping his charges to two counts of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury level felonies both counts had an year maximum the emotionally charged hearing wednesday orbited around eight minutes of body cam footage prosecutors played that appeared to show both boys lifeless bodies patillo took his two sons levi and evan to the river aug after dropping their mother savannah sanders off at work fisherman dylan sherwood testified he remembered that day like the back of my hand patillo showed up around with the boys at the river without fishing gear he said his friend directly asked him if he was on something after patillo appeared to be nodding off and stuck his finger while trying to put bait on the pole they let him borrow they called on patillo when he admitted he was on boy heroin while his two kids were running around near the river sherwood and a friend were unloading gear to fish and stay overnight when realizing he hadn t heard the boys for a few minutes he testified as they went back they saw a pair of hands and knees floating in the river the other child was submerged he said his friend pulled out one child while sherwood started chest compressions he said then patillo yelled for his friend still in the truck who ran over pulled the second child out then took off running the second man was not charged the boys were unresponsive when pulled from the river at the time patillo said that he was beyond sorry and that his life is expletive over an affidavit stated relatives said then the younger boy may have gone into the water first with his big brother following to protect him patillo was on probation at the time of the boys deaths after he pleaded guilty in may to possession of a narcotic drug a level felony in a newton county court case the warrant was recently withdrawn newton county sheriff s deputy ryan halloway said he first met patillo after he was called to his house during a oct heroin overdose sanders was also high on heroin he said patillo was transported to the hospital prosecutor bernard johnsen played footage from halloway s body cam showing both boys who appeared lifeless at the riverbed while he frantically picked up one child to attempt cpr throughout the footage halloway yelled at patillo telling him to get back multiple times at one point threatening to take him to jail about eight minutes of the half hour video was shown before defense lawyer robert varga objected sherwood sat quietly near the back weeping at least two women left the courtroom who did not appear to be relatives patillo bowed his head down and closed his eyes halloway emotional and whose hands were physically shaking at times also looked down as it was played we know what the result is varga said objecting if they have a point did anything else happen on the tape cappas asked i just wanted the court to see what happened johnsen said as halloway exited from his testimony cappas called out to him motioning to patillo sanders texted and left two voicemails for varga that day but did not appear for her testimony on patillo s behalf she had attended multiple prior hearings and testified in favor of lowering his bond eric is a good father varga said offering what sanders said previously the boys were the light of his life sanders herself was a recovering addict but was not responsible for what happened he said she did not want to see him languish in prison over this varga said johnsen responding was sorry sanders did not attend i was hoping she would be here he said she gave the children to someone she knew was a heroin addict and junkie they had a better chance surviving playing with a loaded pistol than at the river with their father he said that s how bad that situation was look at what happened he said they died the state of indiana has to be their voice she is just as guilty as he is johnsen said with his voice rising what did you think was going to happen they are graveyard dead he asked for patillo to get the maximum year sentence in the department of corrections what happened was a tragic accident varga said in years of being an attorney this is easily the most emotional and heart wrenching case i ve been a part of he said it s anger anger at the thought that two boys lost their lives mr patillo has not denied responsibility here vilifying sanders was a bridge too far varga said patillo has been in custody for nearly three years the body cam footage is replayed in his head every day he said the defendant tried heroin first at age soon becoming addicted varga said struggling with addiction should not be a factor used against him in court he argued what is going to be the appropriate punishment for a man who s lost his children and had to see them die in front of him to see it for the rest of his life patillo had seven contacts with law enforcement previously his drug arrests were not violent and what happened at the river was unlikely to happen again his lawyer said he doesn t have any more kids he can t take care of johnsen retorted later in court they re lost varga asked for three years patillo needed drug rehabilitation his lawyer said he spent three years in jail with minimal mental health counseling which was nearly impossible especially after covid restrictions patillo wanted to get out and work with other addicts share his story that s admirable varga said it just doesn t go away patillo said who cried through his statement there s a lot of people that have to deal with what happened halloway sherwood his family sanders he said patillo hoped his story would help someone else the case was one of the worst things i ve seen cappas said agreeing with varga the judge had to balance patillo s addiction with the tragedy of his two sons deaths i could give him years that s not going to be as bad as the anguish for his actions that day cappas said patillo was not trustworthy due to his heroin addiction the judge said if he got out with minimal drug counseling and mental health treatment he would be extremely tempted to relapse and probably overdose he said in the end patillo received years on each count to run consecutively with a mandatory drug program stint that could lead to a revised sentence varga said he planned to appeal the boys mostly lived with their grandparents due to drug use in the parents home according to the indiana department of child services child abuse and neglect fatalities report they had not been removed prior to their deaths patillo picked the boys up from the grandparents home before he took them to the river it said,father spend time prison high heroin two young son river eric indiana department wednesday judge samuel ordered

weather,nature based solutions offer a way forward the twin crises of nature loss and climate change are inextricably linked for too long however biodiversity loss and climate change have been discussed and dealt with in siloes even by independent international frameworks of the un convention on biological diversity and the un framework convention on climate change however we may be at an important turning point for the first time intergovernmental scientific bodies for each global challenge the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes have worked together on a report the result of a co sponsored workshop of climate and biodiversity experts the report finds that we can either solve both crises or solve neither why does addressing nature loss matter these impacts all contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss as these crises worsen they reinforce one another for example changes in temperature or rainfall due to a changing climate can cause loss of habitats and deplete ecosystems of their sustenance related biodiversity loss then can reduce nature s ability to store carbon thus exacerbating climate change both of these are not only problems for the environment but have grave consequences on human wellbeing and livelihoods particularly relating to public health and food security if we continue to address climate change and biodiversity loss separately we will continue to take one step forward and two steps back for example quick fixes for storing carbon such as planting non native trees can promote monoculture plantations that run the risk of eradicating biodiversity and ecosystem services which could have damaging and expensive repercussions on livelihoods and our health the good news is that solutions that reduce such trade offs exist to halt climate change and biodiversity loss we need to combine emission reduction interventions with those that allow nature to flourish such as nature based solutions nbs for example when transforming land for renewable energy an integrated approach would include grazing and cropping around solar panels simultaneously providing benefits to pollinators and other wildlife while producing food and clean energy other win win scenarios highlighted in the report include halting deforestation in biodiversity hotspots and carbon rich ecosystems such as rainforests peatlands and mangroves according to the report we use more than percent of all land on earth for food and timber production therefore transitioning to net zero nature positive practices in the agriculture and forestry sectors also would provide significant co benefits for climate nature and people nbs can help both reduce emissions and increase our resilience to unavoidable future shocks nbs could provide percent of co mitigation needed by to maintain global warming within degrees fahrenheit and at a lower cost than other options marine and terrestrial ecosystems are the only carbon sinks we have and have the capacity to absorb the equivalent of some percent of global man made emissions with the potential to do even more equally wetlands and forests can secure water supplies during droughts trees can help to cool down cities during heatwaves and mangroves can protect against coastal floods research shows that investing in nature could provide million jobs by and the covid pandemic has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to reset humanity s relationship with the environment the decisions citizens business and governments take in the near future will shape the world for decades to come recovery packages should be combined with strong actions including removing harmful subsidies that do not serve the public good and supporting people with the necessary training and reskilling in green jobs a recent study found that every spent by both the public and private sectors on addressing climate change and biodiversity loss can generate up to worth of return the world economic forum is committed to strengthening the link between the climate and nature agendas its community of champions for nature is promoting an integrated land and oceans management to deliver a resilient economy and equitable society the forum s nature action agenda also recently launched two initiatives that are promoting net zero nature positive transformations in the urban and food systems which are top drivers of ghg emissions and biodiversity loss million farmers and biodivercities by if we continue to address climate change and biodiversity loss separately we will continue to take step forward and steps back nature is an important ally in the fight against climate change and addressing nature loss together with climate change offers wide benefits for businesses and jobs as we face further environmental economic and health shocks net zero nature positive economies not only would reduce the likelihood of future pandemics but also safeguard against future crises awareness of the dangers of climate change has never been higher and since the start of the pandemic which found people locked up indoors people have yearned for and connected with nature as never before let us not forget these lessons and ensure that we urgently opt for solutions to global challenges that learn from the complex harmony of the natural world rather than simplifying it to unsustainable outcomes while the integration of climate change and nature in policymaking and business strategy is not where it should be the message is clear the longevity of our societies and economies depends on it,nature based offer way forward twin crisis nature loss climate change inextricably linked long however loss

weather,josh brasted getty images a new conservation strategy unveiled earlier this spring by the national park service is very much against the idea that we can keep things as they were one nps official recently told newsweek a joshua tree is pictured in the photo above at joshua tree national park on january for the first time since the founding of the national park service nps the government agency is no longer approaching park management with the belief that all species ecosystems and landscapes can be preserved as they currently exist the change in conservation strategy has actually been coming for a while as a direct result of climate change according to gregor schuurman an ecologist at the nps climate change response program the press of climate change is not letting up any time soon in fact it s intensifying and predicted to keep doing so schuurman told newsweek this push is very much against the idea that we can keep things as they were the nps unveiled its page plan of attack for what it refers to as climate smart planning and management earlier this spring the plan was developed in partnership with the national wildlife federation nwf and is intended to serve as a guide for the country s more than parks which encompass more than million acres throughout the country bruce stein a nwf scientist who co wrote the guide said the rapidly changing climate threatens to undermine decades of conservation work in our national parks according to a nps news release stein added that the proposed climate smart approach will be key to safeguarding wildlife and other park resources in a warming and increasingly uncertain future what is the paris climate agreement the new strategy was developed organically as nps officials worked with parks across the schuurman said while the nps has always emphasized the importance of keeping things natural climate change he said that can be tied to human activity has accelerated some of the natural environmental changes that organizations like the nps grew to expect there s always been some dynamism but human activity intensifies that schuurman said we have to manage for change and not just for persistence he said the nps published its new guide as a way to advise parks around the country on how to make increasingly difficult park management decisions opinions on any given park s most concerning vulnerabilities vary from one person to the next he said but the guide can help park officials with the triaging process robert alexander getty images a national park service sign welcomes visitors to joshua tree national park in california on february as an example schuurman said if a species is only considered moderately threatened by climate change but plays a vital role in its larger ecosystem that species may take top priority over a species that is more seriously threatened but on which its ecosystem is not as dependent like individual species parks vary in terms of the extent to which they are under threat parks located in the american southwest are among those that are pretty darn vulnerable due to drought warming temperatures and wildfire risk schuurman said during a recent interview with kpbs schuurman discussed the really difficult situation at joshua tree national park which is located just over miles east of los angeles in southern california despite the drought and warming temperatures threatening some species at joshua tree schuurman said others may be able to thrive as those conditions intensify a possibility that christian delich who works as one of the park s climate educators echoed as it continues to get warmer and a bit drier in the mojave desert certain species within the park are going to be able to take advantage of those conditions and actually expand delich told newsweek other species are likely to face more difficulties in surviving the changing climate delich said that does n t necessarily mean that the species will go extinct but they could eventually disappear from the parks in which they currently thrive at joshua tree delich said horned lizards are among the species considered very vulnerable as the climate continues to dry out and heat up robert alexander getty images a dead fallen joshua tree decomposes on the ground in joshua tree national park in california on february i m worried about the future of pinyon pines within the park of california juniper of horned lizards even the creosote bush a lot of those species that maybe the average visitor might not see as important in comparison with the trees for which the park was named delich said meanwhile global climate models are predicting a sharp decline by in the joshua tree population he said the trees were granted temporary endangered species status last fall but delich said he still finds the limited number of joshua tree seedlings seen throughout the park worrying joshua trees are not unique to joshua tree national park but delich said they used to occupy a much larger chunk of territory to years ago giant sequoia trees are another example of a species that used to span several western states but are now secluded to a region along the western sierra nevada these kinds of shifts are natural delich said but climate change spurred on by the burning of fossil fuels and co emissions have caused that to accelerate he added every species on planet earth comes and goes nothing lasts forever delich said even though it is not the nps job to make huge decisions that could impact an entire ecosystem s future the nps is not supposed to interfere as delich said tangible human impacts can be difficult for the agency to overlook on a smaller scale delich said park rangers occasionally revegetate areas that some among the park s nearly million annual visitors drive through while in search of parking but schuurman said climate change necessitates a more unified and forward looking response josh brasted getty images a joshua tree is photographed in joshua tree national park on january if the conditions climatically that used to sustain a suite of species have shifted then efforts to sustain the historical ecological condition may very well come at the expense of keeping others as they historically were because the context has changed he said as an example schuurman described a hypothetical conundrum about how to help cool water fish survive in a stream that is growing warmer doing so may require increasing the amount of shade in the area which may require planting additional trees along the stream s edge some of these hypothetical scenarios are possible schuurman said but all potential impacts on the ecosystem in question need to be taken into account before any decisions are made and that s a tricky task since climate change is manipulating the extenuating factors so quickly that s where we think trying to hold on can lead you to some difficult choices that begin to challenge the larger values of what you re trying to do

avengers campus seeks to be an immersive experience that allows guests to become super heroic across a series of rides shows and eateries from the marvel cinematic universe we re excited to finally open up the gates and let everybody in scot drake a portfolio creative executive with walt disney imagineering said at the park wednesday we had plus years of stories and amazing characters to pull from epic films and for us it was what is the best way to get our guests right in the middle of those stories right in the middle of the action central to that aim is web slingers a spider man adventure which combines classic ride structure with an array of cameras that capture guests body motion and allows them to play peter parker the experience resembles the videogame competition of disneyland s buzz lightyear ride but the action and the tech behind it are in a different galaxy with no equipment necessary though enhancement gadgets for the wrist can be bought next door riders can blast swarms of the little spider bots which can also be purchased next door and a couple of not so little ones what was really important to us was to try and make the interface disappear so the guests just had the superpowers themselves said brent strong executive creative director of walt disney imagineering so in order to do that we did a whole bunch of invention to try and make the technology as un obvious as possible journalists got to take the ride for a few spins wednesday with each pass the experience changes as guests start to master their web slinging and figure out they can do more than just blast away with their powers elsewhere majestic music blasts to announce the marching arrival of the dora milaje the royal guard that protects t challa in black panther with their leader okoye the shaven headed women of wakanda twirl their spears and explain their principles to give wannabe warriors in the audience a lesson in the fighting arts the show includes something rare for a day at disneyland a moment of silence for the dead while okoye tells the crowd she seeks to honor fallen kings and ancestors the ritual in a time of many such moments feels like an acknowledgment of the many deaths during the pandemic that kept the park dark for more than a year it also feels like an acknowledgement of black panther star chadwick boseman whose death last year stunned the world disney s two anaheim parks reopened with restrictions on april and will reopen at something nearing normal on june the new section was also built to incorporate guardians of the galaxy mission breakout a drop tower ride with funky tunes in place since the storytelling on the avengers campus even extends to the food including an outlet of the shawarma joint that iron man suggests his allies hit up after the battle of new york depicted in s the avengers it was open for sampling wednesday and as tony stark promised it is indeed good another avengers campus is planned for disneyland paris the california version will have major additions other heroes including thor and iron man will make appearances and doctor strange will work his wizardry in his ancient sanctum several times a day some of those heroes in marvel s movies are dead and for those who follow the events of the marvel cinematic universe with near religious precision it can be tough to tell what time period the campus is set in we ve summoned heroes from across all of space and time strong said time is a lot more squishy than any of us think trying to put a specific date to it can be challenging but to us avengers campus is here and now,getting assemble last descending getting assemble last descending campus immersive experience become super heroic across series marvel cinematic

professionals on how to grow hemp through a vegetative state and how to ensure the proper conditions to grow flowers to get cbd hemp is a member of the cannabis sativa l plant species which has enjoyed popularity because one of the more famous members is marijuana while both hemp and marijuana come from the same species they contain very unique biological structures which make them two very different plants marijuana plants produce dense thick buds and grow very bushy hemp plants are very thin and tall and don t produce the buds that marijuana is famous for if you take a closer look at both plants in a side by side comparison there is no mistaking one from the other ultimately the difference that is of the biggest interest is in the amount of the cannabinoid that each contains marijuana can contain up to of thc while hemp plants contain less than thc this raises the question what is hemp used for hemp was usually grown for industrial purposes for making fibers nutritional seeds used to make hemp seed oil but most recently it s grown for cbd cannabidiol the cbd industry has exploded in recent years and is estimated to be worth over billion by the year and with the

since it can be cultivated year round and won t face the limitations of a defined growing season firstly you should define the area where you wish to grow hemp the square footage next you should purchase the appropriate number of grow lights such as hid lights high intensity discharge which are most commonly used as the creators of the premium difference note two of the most common models of hid lights are hps high pressure sodium or mh metal halide models both of which should have appropriate reflective hoods and ballasts other popular options are led lights since they are usually cheaper than hid lights furthermore they can also lower operating costs since they consume less energy with these essential elements in place all you have to do is focus on maintaining the following growing conditions six parameters need to be maintained in the proper margins for a hemp flower to grow properly firstly the temperature needs to be maintained between degrees f since hemp requires slightly cooler temperatures secondly relative humidity needs to be in the range when the plants are flowering and is essential for flower growth additional factors include air circulation light for flowering water and feed which are very important to consider as to not kill the hemp plant or prevent it from flowering this is something that should be avoided if you re looking to grow cbd flowers air circulation is necessary to remove fungus gnats and other leaf fungal diseases in addition to this the circulating air will cool plants too as for the lighting conditions after the vegetative growth the plants should be triggered to flower by changing the photoperiod hours on hours off two additional aspects are watering and feeding do not over water the plants when they are flowering but also don t allow them to keep drying out a liquid fertilizer needs to be used after the vegetative growth period which provides less nitrogen and more potassium and phosphorus to support the,growing

time in harbor s life he had been in law enforcement for years in plano and retired dec he learned that rescue shelters pay transporters between and to transport dogs usually with crates on a truck so harbor proposed a business plan to lori armes a volunteer at the wise county animal shelter in decatur what if we formed a nonprofit and supported it with donations harbor wanted to deliver rescue dogs to people for free the shelter could designate the dogs for rescue and then transport them to families who wanted to adopt them armes and harbor joined forces and shiloh s road to hope was born

sits in the front seat he says he has built her a platform with a bed but she doesn t usually go to sleep while he drives if i m awake she keeps up she s usually exhausted when we are done and once the other dogs are unloaded she beats me to bed harbor says during blizzards and bad weather shiloh stays with harbor s sister in law harbor says he averages to dogs in crates inside the motor home

crime,national basketball association north american professional q a abdul jabbar talks new documentary mlk social justice file kareem abdul jabbar poses in the press room at the nba awards in santa monica calif on june the nba legend serves as an executive producer and narrator of the one hour documentary fight the power the movements that changed america which airs june on the history channel los angeles ap kareem abdul jabbar is an nba legend but the man known for his trademark skyhook shot has also devoted his life advocating for equality and social justice abdul jabbar will take another step in his activism walk as an executive producer and narrator of the documentary fight the power the movements that changed america which premieres saturday on the history channel the one hour documentary explores the history of protests that shaped the course for justice in america fight the power examines the labor movement of the s women s suffrage and civil rights along with the lgbtq and black lives matter initiatives it also features footage from abdul jabbar s personal experiences when he covered one of martin luther king news conferences at age and attended the famous cleveland summit where prominent black athletes such as bill russell and jim brown discussed muhammad ali s refusal to serve in the vietnam war abdul jabbar said co executive producer deborah morales was adamant about the documentary needing to include all groups impacted by bigotry and discrimination his pursuit toward social justice for marginalized people prompted the nba to create an award bearing his name last month in a recent interview abdul jabbar spoke with the associated press about the importance of project his unforgettable conversation with king and how emmett till and james baldwin were catalysts to his social justice journey ap why does the documentary focus on several different movements abdul jabbar for me it is trying to show that what black americans must deal with has been experienced by other marginalized groups all of us at one time or another have been targeted by the dominant group so we must understand that all of us are in the same boat and we have to stick up for the rights of every marginalized group not just the ones that we re in that causes controversy but to look at other issues ap when did you first realize people of color were treated unfairly in this country abdul jabbar it started when i was years old that s how old i was when emmett till was murdered and i didn t understand it i asked my parents to explain it they didn t have the words i was like where do i live why am i a target here abdul jabbar i was in the eighth grade i was about years old and i read james baldwin s the fire next time that explained it all to me it gave me an idea of what i had to do and what black americans had to do in order to get out from underneath all of this oppression abdul jabbar i never really saw myself as a leader in all of it i was someone who spoke out i had enough nerve and was crazy enough to speak out about things if we don t talk about the issues they don t get dealt with so somebody has to go out there and speak you remember all the controversy behind lebron james saying shut up and dribble is a lot of you have to just get to that point where you can say that and have people understand what it means ap which personal experience highlighted in the doc stands out to you the most abdul jabbar when i was and i got to interview dr king just to exchange some words with him but to understand what his message actually meant i never really compared it side by side with what malcolm x was talking about when you do that you find out actually that they had the two different approaches to the same end freedom justice and equality for all americans equality that s what it should be about ap what s your biggest takeaway from the documentary abdul jabbar it s a series of steps forward but there s also some backsliding and a lot of attempts to move everything backwards we had to deal with what people were really talking about making america great again it wasn t about being great it was about being ruled by a certain group of people they thought that was great but our country should be ruled by the american people and all of us have a vote in all of us have a voice and we have to use our voices and our votes in a righteous way abdul jabbar i m hoping i can do a more documentary style piece on the underground railroad there s a dramatic piece on right now that s very well done but we should get into the details and let america understand what it was all about because it s an interesting story abdul jabbar some of the people involved that you would never ever be considered to be heroes of the underground railroad for example what do you know about wild bill hickok when he was a teenager he and his father and uncle help escaping slaves get to canada he lived in central illinois and the escaping slaves would go from

unrest,home us carries out airstrikes in iraq and syria washington the united states carried out airstrikes early monday morning in iraq and syria against two iranian backed militias that the pentagon said had conducted drone strikes against american personnel in iraq in recent weeks the defense department said at president biden s direction military forces earlier this evening conducted defensive precision airstrikes against facilities used by iran backed militia groups in the iraq syria border region the pentagon spokesman john f kirby said in a statement mr kirby said the facilities were used by iranian backed militias including kata ib hezbollah and kata ib sayyid al shuhada to store arms and ammunition for carrying out attacks against places where americans were located in iraq there were no immediate reports of casualties but a military after action review is ongoing pentagon officials said the strikes were the second time that mr biden has ordered the use of force in the region the united states carried out airstrikes in eastern syria in late february against buildings belonging to what the pentagon said were iran backed militias responsible for attacks against american and allied personnel in iraq the latest strikes were carried out by air force fighter bombers based in the region pentagon planners have been gathering information for weeks on the sites and militia networks that use them american officials said on sunday defense secretary lloyd j austin iii and gen mark a milley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff briefed mr biden on attack options early last week and mr biden approved striking the three targets the officials said the strikes were carried out a little more than a week after iran elected a hard liner ebrahim raisi as its next president the military action also came as the negotiations intended to bring the united states and tehran back into compliance with an international nuclear accord have reached a crucial juncture president donald j trump pulled the united states out of the accord in and mr biden has been seeking to revive it on sunday secretary of state antony j blinken discussed the negotiations on the nuclear deal with israel s foreign minister yair lapid who said israel had serious reservations about the accord which would ease sanctions on iran in return for limits on its nuclear program earlier this month the biden administration blocked access to myriad websites linked to iran after the nation held a presidential vote to install mr raisi a close ally of the clerical government s supreme leader as its top elected official pressure has been building for weeks from democrats and republican in congress and from some of mr biden s top advisers and commanders to retaliate against the threat posed by the drones to american diplomats and the troops in iraq who are training and advising iraqi forces at least five times since april the iranian backed militias have used small explosive laden drones that divebomb and crash into their targets in late night attacks on iraqi bases including those used by the and special operations units according to american officials so far no americans have been hurt in the attacks but officials worry about the precision of the drones also called unmanned aerial vehicles or the drones are part of a rapidly evolving threat from iranian proxies in iraq with militia forces specialized in operating more sophisticated weaponry hitting some of the most sensitive american targets in attacks that evaded defenses iran weakened by years of harsh economic sanctions is using its proxy militias in iraq to step up pressure on the united states and other world powers to negotiate an easing of those sanctions as part of a possible revival of the nuclear deal iraqi and american officials say iran has devised the drone attacks to minimize casualties to avoid prompting retaliation american officials said the strikes against two targets in eastern syria and a third just across the border in iraq were carried out about monday local time by a mix of air force f s and f es based in the region the fighter bombers dropped multiple bombs pound and pound satellite guided munitions on each of the three structures american officials said the militias used the sites targeted in syria mainly for storage and logistics purposes the site hit in iraq was used to launch and recover the armed drones which officials said were either made in iran or used iranian technology mr kirby and other administration officials characterized the strikes as defensive but leading lawmakers demanded more details on sunday congress must be briefed on these airstrikes without delay said senator tim kaine democrat of virginia who has led the fight to limit presidential war powers for a decade from the senate foreign relations committee if the strikes were against militias that were using to attack american personnel that would be a conventional self defense action that is justified michael p mulroy a former officer and top middle east policy official at the pentagon has warned that with the technology provided by iran s quds force the foreign facing arm of iran s security apparatus the drones are rapidly becoming more sophisticated at a relatively low cost this action should send a message to iran that it cannot hide behind its proxy forces to attack the united states and our iraqi partners mr mulroy said on sunday but mr biden s top aides have also said they want to avoid the angry rhetorical jabs and tit for tat threats that mr trump often engaged in with iran and its proxies in iraq and avoid escalating tensions with tehran at a time when the white house is trying to nail down the nuclear deal the airstrikes in february against the same militias were also a relatively small carefully calibrated military response seven pound bombs dropped on a small cluster of buildings at an unofficial crossing at the syria iraq border used to smuggle across weapons and fighters those earlier strikes were just over the border in syria to avoid diplomatic blowback to the iraqi government the same calculus influenced the planning for the strike on monday two of the three targets were in syria along the iraqi border and the third was just inside iraqi territory the strikes took place early monday in part to avoid any civilian casualties officials said the united states took necessary appropriate and deliberate action designed to limit the risk of escalation but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message mr kirby said how the militias and iran will respond is unclear and american officials said the relatively small set of airstrikes were unlikely to stop the militia attacks completely after the february strikes there was a lull in militia activity against american locations for several weeks but then an even more dangerous threat emerged the small armed drones,home iraq washington united

science,the curiosity rover is heading for the hills as it continues to explore mars and the proverbial gold it s looking for may surprise you organic salts jpl caltech msss nasa nasa s curiosity mars rover used two cameras to create this selfie in front of mont mercou a rock outcrop that stands feet meters tall image credit nasa jpl caltech msss no that s not for your farm to table cooking organic salt is a key ingredient in the quest for evidence of life on planets beyond earth the rover has been exploring gale crater likely the site of an ancient lake since it began ascending the mile high mount sharp located at the center of the crater in the mission began with the goals of determining if conditions on mars ever supported life as well as characterizing the martian climate and geology curiosity has achieved most of what it was designed to do but it s now crossing into an interesting new phase investigating a transition that occurred on mars billions of years ago evidence observed by robotic missions on mars as well as orbiters circling the red planet have helped scientists determine that it was likely a warmer wetter place about billion years ago that s until some catalyst caused mars to lose most of its atmosphere and become a frozen desert about billion years ago now it s moving into a zone where the rocks grow salty filled with sulfate minerals according to abigail fraeman curiosity deputy project scientist at nasa s jet propulsion laboratory the curiosity mission is managed by staff at the lab which is located in pasadena california the presence of clay rocks suggests that they formed when water was present on the planet sulfate minerals indicate that this water was evaporating or growing more acidic that means curiosity is essentially crossing into a place where this transition from wet to dry occurred on mars so it can directly observe the effects of this ancient climate change they are much more likely to survive on mars than ancient molecules which would have been much more fragile curiosity has already found evidence of organic compounds on mars these could be indicators that ancient microbial life was once present or they could have been formed through natural geologic processes organic salts can add more heft to the idea that organic matter was once on mars but it also adds to the idea that mars could still be habitable today on earth organic salts can be used by some forms of life for energy if we determine that there are organic salts concentrated anywhere on mars we ll want to investigate those regions further and ideally drill deeper below the surface where organic matter could be better preserved said james m t lewis an organic geochemist at nasa s goddard space flight center in greenbelt maryland in a statement new research published by lewis and his team in the journal of geophysical research planets in march suggests that these organic salts are on mars curiosity just has to find them and it s not as easy as it sounds even if these salts were lying directly on the martian surface they have been there for billions of years the thin atmosphere on mars means the salts have been subject to harsh radiation over time which can break down organic matter the researchers have analyzed data from one of curiosity s onboard instruments called sam or the sample analysis at mars this ovenlike chemistry lab located inside the belly of the rover has indirectly indicated that organic salts are present on mars what sam ca n t do is provide direct evidence when the instrument heats up samples of martian soil and rock collected by the rover gases are released that can be used to determine the composition of the samples these could be related to other components in martian soil the data curiosity sends back to earth can be used by scientists to piece together the composition of rock and soil fragments on mars creating a larger picture of what the planet was like billions of years ago we re trying to unravel billions of years of organic chemistry and in that organic record there could be the ultimate prize evidence that life once existed on the red planet lewis said for example sam helped researchers confirm the presence of organic molecules on mars containing carbon which is essential to life as we understand it the fact that there s organic matter preserved in billion year old rocks and we found it at the surface is a very promising sign that we might be able to tap more information from better preserved samples below the surface said jennifer l eigenbrode an astrobiologist at nasa goddard who worked on both the carbon study and the latest research with lewis in a statement curiosity has an array of instruments stashed on board and now researchers are looking to another one as a helpful tool in the search for salt the chemistry and mineralogy instrument or chemin has not detected organic salts so far but nasa scientists believe it could if there are enough of them present both sam and chemin will come into play as curiosity crosses into new territory the sam oven works by heating samples to degrees fahrenheit degrees celsius or higher these scorching temperatures can break down molecules and releases gases lewis and his team wanted to model what kinds of gases organic salts may give off if they made it into the sam oven so they ran an experiment on earth that replicated martian rocks the scientists also simulated samples including perchlorates these salts which are common on mars include chlorine and oxygen but scientists worry that if perchlorates are included in samples they could interfere with the search for organic matter given their composition when heating martian samples there are many interactions that can happen between minerals and organic matter that could make it more difficult to draw conclusions from our experiments so the work we re doing is trying to pick apart those interactions so that scientists doing analyses on mars can use this information lewis said the team was able to show that chemin could be used to detect organic salts the instrument aims x rays at martian samples to determine their composition while the perseverance rover located about miles kilometers away does n t have any instruments that can detect organic salts help will be on the way next year the european space agency s exomars rover launching in will be able to search for samples below the martian surface because it can drill down feet meters into the soil it will carry an instrument developed at goddard that can analyze soil chemistry,curiosity rover heading explore mar proverbial gold looking may surprise organic curiosity mar rover used two create front mont rock outcrop tall image credit farm table cooking

department confirmed that more than people were released from the prison which for decades has been the main facility for political prisoners according to official announcements on state media most if

social,from the pages of medical economics many physicians falsely believe that retirement planning will be easy because they are high income earners however high income does not guarantee smart money management and even physicians aren t immune to making financial missteps to ensure financial health physicians should avoid these common retirement planning mistakes medical school and residency may prevent physicians from entering their earning years until their mid s as such clinicians have less time to accumulate savings and savings have less time in the market to compound unfortunately for many young residents socking away for retirement tends to take a back seat to purchasing a home starting a family or simply not having to live frugally in order to counteract getting a late start physicians will need to increase their savings rate and begin funding their retirement savings as soon as possible because physicians are high earners they usually enjoy a higher standard of living that they would like to maintain in retirement in order to live a comparable lifestyle over an extended retirement period physicians need to find ways to accelerate their savings although it is commonly recommended that the average person saves of their income physicians need to save closer to if not higher than accessing funds before retirement the purpose of retirement planning is to accumulate adequate resources to fund your life post career without running out of money not to fund short term goals such as buying a house or sending a child to college sometimes tunnel vision conquers willpower however and people borrow from their k fund not only does this postpone savings goals but it also brings a potential tax burden and penalty fees even physicians are susceptible to underestimating the escalating cost of health care the rate of increase of health care costs has long surpassed the average annual increase in americans income according to a march study published in the journal of the american medical association health care spending in the united states was trillion or about per person in by these costs are expected to reach trillion or per person lacking estate

politics,hong kong ap for years china has quashed any discussion on the mainland of its bloody crackdown on pro democracy protesters in beijing s tiananmen square nearly erasing what happened from the collective consciousness hong kong ap for years china has quashed any discussion on the mainland of its bloody crackdown on pro democracy protesters in beijing s tiananmen square nearly erasing what happened from the collective consciousness now it may be hong kong s turn as china s ruling communist party pulls the city more directly into its orbit the semi autonomous territories of hong kong and nearby macao were for years the last places on chinese soil allowed to publicly mark the events of june when the people s liberation army opened fire on student led protesters in a crackdown that left hundreds if not thousands dead before last year tens of thousands gathered annually in hong kong s victoria park lighting candles and singing songs to remember the victims but authorities citing the coronavirus pandemic are banning that vigil for the second straight year and a museum dedicated to the event suddenly closed wednesday just two days before friday s anniversary after authorities investigated it for lacking the necessary licenses to hold a public exhibition hong kong s security minister warned residents last week against taking part in unauthorized assemblies in mainland china younger generations have grown up with little knowledge of or debate about the crackdown but the efforts to suppress commemorations in hong kong reflect another turn of the screw in beijing s ever tightening control over hong kong following massive anti government protests in those demonstrations evolved into months of sometimes violent clashes between smaller groups of protesters and police and they have led to a broader crackdown on dissent in the former british colony which was long an oasis of capitalism and democracy and was promised that it would largely maintain its freedoms for years when it was returned to china in since the protests china has imposed a sweeping national security law aimed in part at stiffening the penalties for the actions that protesters engaged in and authorities have sought to arrest nearly all of the city s outspoken and prominent pro democracy figures most are either behind bars or have fled the city despite the restrictions this year there are calls for hongkongers to remember the crackdown in private with vigil organizers calling on residents to light a candle at online calls circulating on social media also urged residents to dress in black on friday local newspaper ming pao last week published an article suggesting that residents write the numbers six and four on their light switches a nod to the june date so each flip of the switch is also an act of remembrance for decades chan kin wing has regularly attended the vigil in hong kong i was lucky to have been born in hong kong if i had been born on the mainland i could have been one of the students in tiananmen square that day said chan whose parents had fled to hong kong from the mainland in the s when june happened all of hong kong witnessed the indelible historical event of students massacred by a corrupt regime chan said this year chan plans to remember the event privately dressing in black and changing his profile picture on social media to an image of a lit candle in the dark i ve resolved to never forget about june and strive to pass on memories of it to ensure it s never forgotten he said in mainland china the group tiananmen mothers that represents victims relatives published an appeal on the human rights in china website urging the party to heed their long held demands for a complete release of official records about the crackdown compensation for those killed and injured and for those responsible to be held to account we look forward to the day when the cpc and the chinese government can sincerely and courageously set the record straight and take up their due responsibility for the anti human massacre in accordance with the law and the facts the statement said while tiananmen mothers said of its members have died since the group was founded in the late s many young chinese it said have grown up in a false sense of prosperous jubilance and enforced glorification of the government and have no idea of or refuse to believe what happened on june in the nation s capital the government however seems intent on running out the clock on such appeals while tiananmen mothers said of its members have died since the group was founded in the late s many young chinese it said have grown up in a false sense of prosperous jubilance and enforced glorification of the government and have no idea of or refuse to believe what happened on june in the nation s capital in hong kong the recent arrests and convictions of prominent activists have had a chilling effect on those who participated in the vigil in the past said chow hang tung the vice chair of the hong kong alliance in support of patriotic democratic movements of china which operates the june museum there will obviously be fear and people cannot just assume that they can come and express their remembrance for the tiananmen massacre victims and be unscathed she said chow said that what keeps her going is the dream that china and hong kong can both have democracy one day the tide though appears to be going in the other direction this is something worth fighting for she said if one day we cannot talk about tiananmen that would signify that hong kong is totally assimilated into chinese society,hong china discussion bloody crackdown pro democracy square nearly collective consciousness hong china discussion bloody crackdown pro democracy square nearly

arts,cleveland ohio cleveland metroparks called it a wrap thursday on a decade long quest to add a new bike and pedestrian connection to lake erie at wendy park on whiskey island some onlookers showed up on a flawless june morning to witness a ribbon cutting signaling completion of the million wendy park bridge which spans the norfolk southern rail lines that divide whiskey island the colorful misnomer for the peninsula west of the mouth of the cuyahoga river it was an absolutely huge crowd brian zimmerman ceo of metroparks said after the event it was pretty humbling to see how many people showed up the bridge was full of people before we dedicated it hundreds of cyclists came through walkers came through joggers were literally running through asked how it felt to see the public response to the bridge s completion zimmerman said i don t know if i could feel any better cleveland metroparks acquired the acre park and an eight acre marina on the peninsula in from cuyahoga county the park occupies the northern portion of the peninsula which is separated by the rail lines from properties on the south side owned by ontario stone a crushed stone supplier and cargill deicing technology which operates a salt mine beneath lake erie the county bought the property in from cleveland businessman dan t moore iii who led a partnership that bought the acreage in from conrail which is now a subsidiary of csx and norfolk southern starting in the late s moore s ambition was to turn the marina into a successful business venture while keeping the adjacent acres open as a publicly accessible park the marina failed to attract enough boaters to make it a financial success but moore succeeded in demonstrating the demand for a new lakefront park on the city s west side now a cleveland metroparks commissioner moore donated million through a private foundation to complete the new million bridge the bridge and the park are named in memory of dan and his wife marge moore s daughter artist wendy moore who died in from complications after suffering a head injury in a skiing accident thursday s event also celebrated the completion of the million whiskey island connector a mile off road trail connecting wendy park to edgewater park located to the west wendy park is one of five units in the acre metroparks lakefront reservation the agency leases four of the five units including edgewater from the city of cleveland the wendy park bridge eliminates a mile detour that had been required to reach wendy park from the south bicyclists and pedestrians can reach the new bridge from the south via a walkway on the willow avenue lift bridge and the cleveland foundation centennial lake link trail on the west bank of the flats about miles south of whiskey island the lake link trail intersects with the mile towpath trail reaching deep into northern ohio the wendy park bridge addresses a large regional audience eager to gain better access to lake erie but it also provides a link for residents of the immediate area in ohio city on cleveland s west side including residents of the cuyahoga metropolitan housing authority s lakeview estates complex which overlooks the old channel of the cuyahoga river just south of whiskey island the new bridge is part of the million tiger projects undertaken by metroparks to provide safe seamless car free connectivity to parks and waterfronts on the city s west side by eliminating gaps such as the one caused by the railroad tracks on whiskey island the projects take their name from an obama era program called transportation investments generating economic recovery other tiger investments include the recently completed red line greenway and trail segments linking cleveland lakefront bikeway to the lake link trail and the

religion,latta plantation refused to apologize saturday for a controversial program whose racist juneteenth event description promised to tell the story of white refugees and defeated confederate soldiers in a lengthy post on the website of the living history museum near charlotte site manager ian campbell who noted that he is black called out charlotte mayor vi lyles and other critics of the event the program was abruptly canceled friday following the backlash to the event and its promotion at issue was the plantation s online and social media promotion for the event called kingdom coming which was set to take place next saturday on juneteenth the holiday commemorates the emancipation of slaves in the united states but the description did n t acknowledge the significance of june th it was sympathetic to those who owned slaves in the wake of emancipation and inaccurately minimized an unnamed slaveowner to an overseer and referred to him as massa the observer previously reported the post also referred to freedmen but did not include that black people were enslaved in the united states for nearly years instead the museum s site referred to slaves as former bondsmen campbell said he created the kingdom coming event and took full responsibility for it he said the confederacy white supremacy overseers plantation owners and white refugees will never be glorified to the masses on social media and politicians no apology will be given for bringing a unique program to educate the public about former slaves becoming free my job will be to continue to educate campbell said historic latta plantation s narrative will be to give a voice to our ancestors enslaved and as freedmen who were denied a voice we will speak for them in a compassionate accurate and sensitive manner the event

instagram post came as she championed body confidence and called out negativity shared towards posts shared online when it comes to health and fitness cheeky it s always popping up on her instagram feed in selfies the presenter has taken from her bedroom mirror saira is often sharing her fitness journey with fans after overhauling her own lifestyle and finding a new love for working out ahead of her th birthday last year questioning why people are turned off by body positive content saira says she chooses to share her own experiences with body confidence to try and inspire others has anyone else noticed that there s a real negativity towards people who share health fitness and body confidence posts comment below i would love to hear your thoughts and experiences saira penned she said i ve become aware for example if i show my stretch marks cellulite bloated stomach people come out and show their me too engagement comments but if i share photos of me in a bikini talking about exercise healthy eating working out in the gym the content is liked by less people and in fact i get more negative comments and people unfollow what i don t understand in a world of an obesity pandemic why are so many people turned off by positive body images where women look fit strong and are proud to show off their hard work relating to their diet and workout regimes i don t post photos of myself for people to compare themselves to me and feel crap about themselves right mindset saira explained that she likes to share photos of her body online so she can be real with her followers

share to show what works for me in order to inspire and help others to become active for themselves to become more positive about their physical and mental health i m finding that there is a really weird attitude at the moment amongst many women where body positivity is celebrated at the expense of body health at body positivity to me is making the very best of myself to help with my self confidence and self esteem insisting there is a danger of women feeling invisible as they get older saira stressed the importance of self care the presenter said so if that means i decide to do something about my cellulite wrinkles or fat rolls around my stomach then i m doing that because i want to not because i feel the pressure to or because i hate myself or because i feel inadequate or that i think i m ugly when women reach a certain age there is a real danger for many to feel invisible i don t want to be that woman i want to keep being visible for me and part of that is investing in my selfcare selfcare selflove selfesteeem selfconfidence selfrespect and self discipline comes in all shapes and sizes let s not discriminate those who choose to live a healthy happy and sporty life fans were seen throwing their support behind saira and insisted she is an inspiration i m an overweight year old and your posts are an inspiration for me to get fitter think positive more

journey a third fan wrote i ve just started getting into fitness more but i do n t think i m ever going to be confident enough to post pictures of myself so i think it s great that you are btw if i looked as good as you i d bore everyone to tears with pics of myself on a serious note you have worked so hard it has certainly paid off you look are looking fab if that s not motivation and encouragement to us all no pain no gain as they saira has become known for honestly speaking about her body online and recently shared a snap of her in a turquoise bikini where she questioned what it means to have a bikini body the mum of two revealed her short stumpy legs thick waist small boobs skin disorder cellulite and stretch marks previously bothered her but she has now realised that self care and self love have helped her learn to love her body why for so long have we normal women subjected ourselves to comparing our bodies to impossible images of super models and the way they look in
