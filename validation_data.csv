labour,"there was an enlightening seminar organised by sdpi recently on pension reforms. it was not only educating but an eye opener to an issue which has a multifaceted impact on the performance of the government and its delivery as it s directly related to the performance and compensation of civil servants. i was invited as one of the panellists due to my active engagement in the past on tapping long term project finance funding through capital market instruments and exposure to this concept of being on the board of various public sector entities. i have always been aware about the seriousness of the issue of growing pension liability for the government and the public sector entities but it was only during the research on this topic that it dawned upon me how grave the circumstances are. i must at the outset thank my colleagues sayem ali and irteza qureshi who had done the research for me on this very critical topic which helped me realise how this existing emerging fiscal burden could be addressed. let s begin with context and the extent of the challenge of the rising pension bill. the federal pension bill has increased to rs480 billion in 2021 from rs150 billion in 2011. according to reports from donors the federal government s unfunded liability currently stands at around rs3 trillion. post the 7th national finance commission award provincial governments pension bills have also increased exponentially to rs500 billion in 2020 from rs75 billion in 2011. studies suggest that with no changes to the existing pension arrangements the federal pension bill will rise to an alarming level of rs750 billion by 2023. provinces are likely to face similar challenges. this is a very frightening situation indeed which becomes more complicated due to the presence of fiscal pressures from compromised tax collections soe losses accumulating circular debt etc. however the silver lining is that out of all fiscal challenges of the government this appears to be an easier one to plug given that this problem is faced by almost every country particularly in the developed world where the average life expectancy is much higher. before we go any further i would like to elaborate on fundamental concepts about pension scheme options which will help readers especially who re not much familiar with this theme. employee benefits classify post employment plans into two categories 1 . defined contribution dc whereby the employer s liability is limited to the amount that it agrees to contribute to the post retirement fund consequently actuarial risk and investment risk falls on the employee. in other words the risk of investment performance of the fund and resultant pension returns rests with the employee or its representatives. the return could be better or worse depending on market factors and competence of the fund manager s whilst on the other hand 2 . defined benefit db is the scheme where the amount of pension benefit is defined therefore all actuarial as well as investment risks are borne by the employer. irrespective of what the market circumstances are and if pension liability is funded or not the employee will get a defined pre set return post retirement there will be no upside or downside for the employee s unlike dc. experience from the last 30 years shows significant changes in pension schemes in most developed and emerging markets. as per international best practices pakistan government s db and unfunded pension arrangements are out of line. non contributory or db schemes are reducing many countries have switched to dc plans due to financial stress. payg financing is also reducing most countries have moved to full or partial funding of future pension liability. the advantage is that the financing burden can be spread across different periods in a more stable and predictable manner. new accounting standards have helped governments better understand the underlying accrued liabilities and the long term costs of their pension arrangements. with enhanced life expectancy and widening fiscal deficits in emerging markets this problem is becoming more glaring. there are successful examples from the countries where the make up of the society and the community are very similar to ours and they have been able to put a check on mushrooming concerns around this dilemma. based on the above this could be concluded that on fiscal management front pension reforms are low hanging fruit in relative terms and could be fixed while keeping the below considerations in perspective . political will is required to implement pay and pension reforms. tried and tested solutions could be borrowed from across the globe. all new hiring in the government shall be under the dc system with restructured pay scales having ranges backed by a pension fund management structure. other than maximum salary and pension entitlement capping halt on retrospective increase in future retirees and subject to legal provisions cull the number of pension beneficiaries extending retirement age or providing less benefits in early retirements are two options which could be implemented in the existing db plans as a package. there is no argument that pension funds need to be developed in pakistan and the pension liability of the government is required to be funded. there has to be a plan which should be managed through a pension fund regime only. the existing db pension liability shall be funded through a combination of in kind assets of the government for example existing properties offices given to pension funds and rented back by the government lands could be handed to funds for development etc. and in cash albeit in tranches as funding in one go is not possible as the government is in borrowing mode and that would put unnecessary debt burden on the country. this plan ticks lots of boxes with the biggest box being conversion of dead assets into earning ones. to reiterate dc pension arrangements are fully funded while returns depend on the pension fund s underlying performance therefore it must allow employees to be party to investment decisions of their own funds. this is a way of empowering employees and making them in charge of their own fate about their future decisions.

environmental,"in north dakota oil and agriculture are the sun. orbiting around them is the state s economic fate. new developments in value added efforts are broadening the market though clearing a prudent path for the state to follow. consider the new soybean crushing plant planned for spiritwood near jamestown in central north dakota. the 350 million facility will produce soybean meal and vegetable oil for food feed and fuel including renewable also known as green diesel. early projections look for the plant to employ about 70 and process approximately 150000 bushels of soybeans per day. there are plenty of beans in the region to keep it busy. in 2019 north dakota produced more than 170 million bushels of soybeans the fourth most of any state in the nation in 2019. when the plant was announced in early may gov. doug burgum called it a gamechanger for north dakota farmers. but it s not just that farmers will have a nearby and ready market for their beans. the greater benefit is the opportunity for regenerated value for those beans thus the true meaning of value added agriculture. burgum calls it a synergy between ag and energy. brent sanford and i ran four years ago we said hey we have food and fuel. we have raw materials and we ship them out of we were like a colony extracting raw materials burgum told the grand forks herald late last month. but we could do value added approaches in both energy and ag. this is one of the biggest value added investments ever made in the state and it has synergies. among those synergies the soybean plant will be partly powered by steam from the nearby great river energy plant. the soybean plant in addition to producing various foodstuffs will sell oil to the marathon refinery in dickinson. marathon will produce green diesel for markets in california. and the governor says the opportunities for synergy between ag and energy continue to grow. this is one of those examples where we can have ag and energy and be moving in a sustainable way all simultaneously burgum said. and that s part of the reason i am so pumped about the future of north dakota. that innovation is going to play such a key role. the new soybean facility represents a collection of even larger benefits than anticipated sen. john hoeven r wrote in an op ed submitted to the state s newspapers. we continue to expand the shared nexus between agriculture and energy and accordingly north dakota continues to lead the way in developing the industries of the future. value added ag is a term that gained popularity a couple of decades ago as farmers and politicians economists and others realized the impact that comes when products and markets are reconsidered and reconfigured to wring the most possible profit from a commodity. the goal is to develop the highest return on any agricultural investment strengthening not only the producer and ag sector but also the economies that rely upon it. but it isn t limited to ag products. it needs to be top of mind across all sectors. the spiritwood plant certainly will provide a boost for the state s agriculture industry but its economic boundaries will overlap into the energy sector.

health,"the is the only industrialized nation in which the maternal death rate has been rising. each year about 700 deaths are due to pregnancy childbirth or subsequent complications according to the centers for disease control and prevention. when someone dies while pregnant or within a year of childbirth in illinois that s considered a maternal death. karen tabb dina is a maternal health researcher at the university of illinois at urbana champaign who serves on a state level committee that s trying to figure out what s killing these mothers. the group s most recent analysis found that about 75 women in illinois die from pregnancy related causes each year. consistent with national trends black women are at greater risk than white women and most of the deaths were preventable. it s cause for alarm tabb dina said. our country is in a crisis in terms of unnecessary maternal deaths. in recent years illinois maternal mortality review committee has urged policy changes that would remove barriers to health care for pregnant and postpartum women. at the top of the list make sure low income moms don t lose medicaid coverage after a baby is born. some women lose coverage as soon as two months after giving birth. in april illinois became the first state to be approved by the department of health and human services to extend medicaid up to a full year after a pregnancy. this is tremendous tabb dina said. one of the greatest risk factors for maternal deaths is lack of access to care not being able to access the right providers and to be seen in a timely manner. medicaid the state and federal program mainly for low income americans covers people with higher incomes during pregnancy but most states kick these women off the rolls 60 days after they give birth. as a result hundreds of thousands of women who ve recently had a baby end up uninsured each year. disruptions in medicaid coverage results in higher costs and worse health outcomes hhs secretary xavier becerra said in a press briefing in april citing a federal report on the consequences of medicaid churning. more than half of pregnant women in medicaid experienced a coverage gap in the first six months of postpartum care. with the extension of medicaid under the affordable care act mothers in illinois with incomes up to about double the federal poverty level can keep their coverage for a year postpartum. several other states including new jersey georgia and virginia are taking similar steps. although the trillion american rescue plan was passed to stimulate the economy amid the covid 19 pandemic it also contains a less noticed provision addressing the postpartum coverage. for the 12 states that never expanded medicaid under the aca the law provides new financial incentives for them to make medicaid available to adults with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level 12880 for an individual 21960 for a family of three . in addition the stimulus package offers all states an easier option for extending postpartum medicaid coverage beyond the 138 income limit. starting in april 2022 states can file a state plan amendment to their medicaid program a process that has fewer roadblocks to federal approval than the traditional route of applying for a federal waiver. maternal health experts say extending medicaid coverage to a full year postpartum makes sense because pregnancy related complications physical and mental aren t limited to the first few months. many postpartum health issues and health problems extend beyond the 60 day period that medicaid is currently covering said dr. rachel bervell an obstetrician in seattle and co founder of the black obgyn project which aims to raise awareness about racial injustices in maternal health care. a report based on data from nine states found nearly 20 of pregnancy associated deaths happen between 43 days and one year postpartum. bervell clearly recalls learning about that statistic. it was just so jarring she said. it makes you worried about the 1 in 5 individuals we may be missing. medicaid is the largest payer for maternity care in the united states. black women are overrepresented in the medicaid population and are also overrepresented among those who get kicked off their plan after 60 days. chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension are more prevalent and less well controlled among black women putting them at higher risk of pregnancy related complications. there are also structural barriers to health care such as inadequate housing transportation and child care. many of these barriers stem from racist and discriminatory policies like redlining linked to worse health outcomes. black mothers are also more likely to be denied medication for postpartum pain. racial disparities in maternal health outcomes are caused by racism not race. so the problem can t be solved bervell said without addressing systemic racism in medicine and the broader society. robin kelly d ill. said the racial disparities are unacceptable. she championed the state s medicaid change and is working on other policies to improve maternal health data collection and establish national obstetric emergency protocols. when you look at educated black women with money they still die more than less educated less wealthy white women she said. kelly said she first became aware of the issue several years ago when she met the family of kira johnson a black mother who died after the birth of her second child from obstetrical bleeding one of the most common causes of maternal death in the as the rate of maternal deaths in the has ticked upward so has the incidence of severe maternal morbidity according to the cdc. each year an estimated 50000 women experience dangerous even life threatening health complications. jessica davenport williams a mother in chicago said that after giving birth the first time she hemorrhaged severely and had to receive blood transfusions. she was pregnant with her second daughter around the time serena williams and beyonc were in the news because of their own serious childbirth complications. i wanted to make sure that every physician was well aware of my history that they documented information in my file that would be transferred to the hospital. and i was met with resistance she said. they didn t feel that it was necessary. i had to push for several appointments for that to happen. after her second daughter was born via cesarean section davenport williams hemorrhaged again. davenport williams said her experience compelled her to become an advocate for maternal health. i don t know if i will see the change for myself in my lifetime she said. but i definitely don t want my daughters to have the same story or experiences that many before them have had. while extending medicaid coverage is an important first step efforts to prevent maternal death can t stop there tabb dina said. health care providers need to be educated about racial inequities in medicine she said. screening all pregnant and postpartum women for mental illness and making sure they get treatment will also help save lives. we need to understand the real lived stories of our near misses tabb dina said. what were their barriers what were their complications . and then ask what more needs to change so no child has to grow up without a mother whose death could have been prevented . khn kaiser health news is a national newsroom that produces in depth journalism about health issues. together with policy analysis and polling khn is one of the three major

labour,"cruising down the romantic rhine river we dodge the treacherous reefs that spelled disaster for ancient sailors distracted by the fabled lorelei siren. we dock at the half timbered town of bacharach where i jump out. bacharach wearing a castle helmet and a vineyard cape is a typical rhine village. it lines the river and fills its tiny tributary valley with a history you can hook arms with in a noisy weinstube. bacharach means altar to bacchus. the town and its wine date from celtic and roman times. local vintners brag that the medieval pope pius ii preferred bacharach s wine and had it shipped to rome by the cartload. today tourists drink it on the spot. for each wine festival bacharach installs an honourary party mayor. he s given the title of bacchus. the last bacchus one of the best wine gods in memory died a year ago. posters left up seemingly as a memorial show his pudgy highness riding a keg of riesling wearing a tunic and crowned with grapes as adoring villagers carry him on happy shoulders. bacharach s annual wine fest is the first weekend of october just before the harvest. its purpose is to empty the barrels and make room for the new wine a chore locals take seriously. the festival is months away but the dank back alleys of bacharach smell like the morning after. i drop my bag at hotel kranenturm and meet my guide. as with every visit to my favourite town on the rhine i ve arranged a private walk through town with herr jung bacharach s retired schoolmaster. herr jung and i climb through the vineyards to a bluff overlooking a six mile stretch of rhine. i came here often as a boy to count the ships he says. i once saw 30 in the river in front of bacharach. we look out over the town s slate rooftops. picking up a stone he carves the letters rick into a slate step and tells me now you are here carved in stone until the next rain. ever a teacher he explains slate is very soft. the rhine river found this and carved out this gorge. soil made from slate absorbs the heat of the sun. so our vines stay warm at night. we grow a fine wine here on the rhine. today the vineyards are going back to the wild. germans won t work for the small pay. the polish come to do the work. during the solidarity time i housed a guest worker. after 11 weeks in the fields he drove home in a used mercedes. we pass under the fortified gate and walk back into town cradled safely in half timbered cuteness. my teacher can sense what i m thinking that bacharach was never good for much more than inspiring a poem selling a cuckoo clock or docking a boat. stopping at a bench herr jung props his soft leather briefcase on his knee and fingers through a file of visual aids each carefully hand coloured and preserved in plastic for rainy walks. he pulls out a sketch of bacharach with fortifications intact and busy with trade to show how in its heyday from 1300 to 1600 the town was rich and politically important. medieval bacharach had 6000 people. that was big in the 15th century he says. but the plagues fires and religious wars of the 17th century ended our powerful days. bacharach became empty. it was called the cuckoo other people moved in the way a cuckoo takes over an empty nest. for 200 years now our town has been only a village of a thousand. in the mid 19th century painters and poets like victor hugo were charmed by the rhineland s romantic mix of past glory present poverty and rich legend. they put this part of the rhine on the grand tour map. and the romantic rhine was born. a ruined 15th century chapel hangs like a locket under the castle and over the town. in 1842 victor hugo stood where herr jung and i now stand. looking at the chapel he wrote no doors no roof or windows a magnificent skeleton puts its silhouette against the sky. above it the ivy covered castle ruins provide a fitting crown. this is bacharach land of fairy tales covered with legends and sagas. and i think to myself travellers happy to have stopped in.

other," bpt the classroom environment changed tremendously throughout the pandemic with many children studying at home full or part time. this meant additional gear for many such as tablets and workbooks while some items like backpacks went unused while studying remotely. as millions of students head back to the classroom for the start of the 2021 22 school year backpacks will be a necessity again and experts have some advice to ensure a safer start to the school year. with a focus on getting back in the classroom and returning to normal it s easy to overlook possible injuries caused by everyday school supplies said american academy of orthopaedic surgeons spokesperson emily dodwell md mph faaos a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon at hospital for special surgery in new york. backpacks might not seem that high on the list of safety hazards for children but if too heavy or worn improperly they can cause pain or injury to muscles and joints. some potential problems could include wearing the backpack on only one shoulder or a small child carrying heavy objects like a textbook tablet or computer. as part of its prevent injuries america campaign the aaos is spreading the word that backpacks that are too heavy or are worn incorrectly can cause numerous problems. improperly used backpacks may injure or overuse muscles and joints. this can lead to back neck and shoulder pain as well as posture problems. this is especially concerning for students in hybrid learning environments because they may need to carry more items back and forth to school and home throughout the week. tips for selecting and using school backpacks . shopping for a backpack is a fun part of preparing to go back to school but many kids will prioritize fashion over function. caregivers can help guide children to choose a backpack they like that also benefits their well being. aaos recommends backpacks that are lightweight with a waist or chest strap and two shoulder straps that are wide and padded. rolling backpacks are a good option as well. if your child resists using a traditional two strap backpack a well structured crossbody bag may be a reasonable compromise. after you have a well designed high quality backpack the next step is to use it correctly. to prevent injury when using a backpack encourage kids to . 1. always use both shoulder straps when carrying the backpack. the correct use of both of the wide well padded shoulder straps will help distribute the weight of the backpack across the back. 2. ensure the straps are snug to keep the load closer to the back. backpacks should not be too low and bouncing around while walking. 3. organize the items inside so that heavier items are low and toward the center of the backpack. 4. pack light removing items if the backpack is too heavy. carry only those items that are required for the day and if possible leave unnecessary books at home or school. 5. lift properly by bending at the knees when picking up a backpack. what if your child experiences pain . in addition to helping your student select a good backpack continue to watch how they use it throughout the school year. if it s a struggle to put on and take off you may need to step in. if a child complains that his or her bag is too heavy or is hurting his or her back it is a good idea to lighten the load or consider a wheeled backpack said dodwell. whether your child returns to school full time or is on a hybrid schedule remind them not to carry more than they need at one time. if your student has a locker encourage them to visit it when time permits throughout the day to swap supplies. in addition to back pain watch out for numbness tingling or discomfort in the arms or legs symptoms which may also indicate poor backpack fit or too much weight being carried. do n t ignore any back pain in a child or teenager and reach out to your physician for evaluation. to learn more visit """

unrest,"there are not many foods that have such an intense and unmistakable fragrance as basil. walk into a kitchen with a bouquet of basil in a glass jar or brush against a plant in the garden and you immediately recognize that aroma. it s the fragrance of early morning at the farmers market in summer. basil enhances all the summer vegetables but especially summer squash tomatoes eggplant and green beans. it defines much of the cooking of the mediterranean the main ingredient of pesto and a key flavor for pasta sauces frittata pizza and tomato salads. basil is a foundation of seasoning in thailand burma and vietnam. so it s not too surprising to learn that basil is native to much of the tropics from india through southeast asia. there are many types of basil. the one we see most often are varieties of so called sweet basil also known as genovese. basil typically found in the market has medium to large green leaves with a clear spicy flavor of anise or licorice. similar in flavor are the piccolo fino varieties with tiny green leaves or the lettuce leaf types with huge crinkly leaves. there are also purple leaved varieties of sweet basil that i find are more interesting for their color than their flavor. other varieties of sweet basil may have hints of cinnamon or cloves. thai basil is a sub species that is stronger and more clove scented. i also like lemon basil especially for fish dishes. because basil is native to the tropics it thrives in the garden during hot weather. its beautiful leaves and fragrance make it ideal in edible landscapes or in tubs on the patio. basil is ideal for people who feel like they have no space to garden. a pot on the kitchen windowsill is decorative and always within reach when needed. remember to regularly groom your basil plants by pinching off any flower buds that form at the end of the stems. if these are left on the plant will stop producing new leaves. dried basil like dried tarragon is pretty much a waste of time and money. the fragrance the plants dispense so generously when fresh pretty much disappears with drying. because of its thin delicate leaves basil needs special care for storage. i treat basil as i would cut flowers. as soon as i get home from the market i remove any ties from the bunch and cut off the bottom half inch of the stems. i fill a tall glass with tepid water and put the basil in up to the bottom leaves. basil can be very thirsty so add water every day. try to use basil within a few days. some people have good luck storing basil in a plastic bag in the refrigerator but i usually end up with lots of blackened leaves. to freeze take the leaves off the stems and blanch them for a few seconds in boiling water. drain and pat dry and lay them out in little stacks. wrap airtight in plastic. basil is easy to use. with basil tomatoes and fresh mozzarella you can make a caprese salad seasoning with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. or use the same ingredients baked on a margherita pizza. basil adds summer warmth to almost any vegetable dish and is especially important for ratatouille. or try a mediterranean vegetable gratin based on a layer of saut ed onions flavored with garlic and basil topped with alternating stripes of sliced eggplant zucchini and tomatoes. drizzle with olive oil and bake until the vegetables are tender. a soup that can only be made in the summer is the proven ale soupe au pistou. this vegetable stew is based on a flavorful lamb broth with summer vegetables added tomatoes green beans shell beans and summer squash. pistou is the french word for the basil pur e stirred into the soup at the end. tomato bruschetta needs basil and garlic to balance the flavors especially when piled on grilled baguette. if i can t find thai basil i like to make a fresh seasoning combining basil mint and cilantro. i recently used this combo in a thai cooking class at tess in vegetable summer rolls as well as on a mango salad. fresh basil just needs a quick rinse under cold water before using. pat it dry in a kitchen towel. whole leaves can be used generously. if you want smaller pieces tearing the leaves by hand results in less bruising and discoloration than chopping. to make a fine chiffonade stack the leaves a few at a time and slice in thin strands with a very sharp knife. some cooks like to roll the leaves up in a coil before slicing but i think this a recipe for bruising and blackening. when you find yourself with too much basil to use at one time make pesto. the name comes from the italian word for pestle as in mortar and some patient cooks still pound away as it creates the most intense flavor. a blender or a food processor makes a delicious approximation. the area of liguria around genoa is as famous for its walnut orchards as it is for basil. the genovese would never think of using pine nuts more common in other parts of italy. if you use a large mortar and pestle crush the garlic and nuts before adding the basil leaves. 2 cups lightly packed basil leaves . 2 or 3 cloves garlic chopped . cup pine nuts or walnuts chopped . process the basil leaves in a food processor or blender with enough oil to facilitate the process until a chunky pur e. add the garlic and nuts and continue processing to a somewhat smooth texture.

behind the gathering put the event on covid related hiatus but it s back on in 2021 and should occur right after the july 4th holiday. the informal setting and preponderance of casual wear has led some to dub the week long event summer camp for moguls. the guest list for sun valley is once again overflowing with the kind of bold faced names with the cash and egos to spur a fresh wave of m a.

she has said she won t run if donald trump makes another bid. other pols and beltway insiders include council of foreign relations president richard haass former secretary of transportation elaine

entry at sun valley but the professors and school presidents are useful for the panel discussions that form much of the week s activities. behind closed doors guests are treated to talks on everything from global terrorism to public education to global warming. afternoons are spent biking whitewater rafting and barbecuing. this year s group of ivory tower denizens includes the university of chicago

labour,"german health minister jens spahn is facing fierce cross party criticism after a report emerged unveiling plans to dispose of unusable face masks by handing them out to vulnerable groups amid the coronavirus pandemic. the ministry of health bmg on saturday hit back at the claims made in the german magazine der spiegel saying all its masks had been tested to a high standard and that protection of the wearer was its top priority. the magazine on friday reported that the ministry of health had ordered face masks from china in spring 2020 for an estimated 1 billion billion . the order was placed amid a global mask shortage and had not been tested to meet eu standards. due to this the masks were unable to be used on arrival and needed to undergo emergency testing to be deemed fit for use. the ministry of health under spahn drew up plans to distribute the masks to the homeless the disabled or hartz iv benefit recipients the magazine reported. but the ministry of labor which is responsible for mask safety refused to give its approval to the plan. social democratic party spd general secretary lars klingbeil told der spiegel on saturday that the plan was outrageous and inhumane. attempting to get rid of useless masks by giving them away to needy groups in our society . this is simply beyond cynicism and absolutely unacceptable katja mast parliamentary group vice chair also of the spd wrote on twitter on saturday. the parliamentary leader of the left party jan korte said that it no longer seems to matter that the health minister once again seems not to care about the health of disabled and socially disadvantaged people if his own failures are covered up as a result. the pro business free democratic party fdp vice chair michael theurer called for a special investigator from the federal audit office to look into the issue of the unused masks in comments to the handelsblatt business newspaper. the health ministry hit back at the accusations on saturday saying that strict attention had been paid to quality during the procurement of medical goods including face masks during what it described as an emergency situation. as soon as the goods were identified as defective the ministry did not pay for them the bmg added. the best possible protection of the citizens and employees living there was at all times in the foreground when it came to delivering masks to facilities for homeless and disabled people the ministry also stressed. other considerations played no role on the part of the bmg. according to der spiegel there is currently a plan to store the masks in a national emergency reserve of the federal government. when they reach their expiration date they will be destroyed. but the bmg also disputed this saying decisions on the destruction of stocks have not been made by the federal government. the masks were fully usable for infection control it said. the bmg said there were plans to transfer the masks to the newly created national reserve for health protection.

social,conversation shift from you need to help us to we need your help . about 60 members of the crested butte community showed up last week to butte bagels to express their concerns with the current local housing crisis and brainstorm ideas for how to help solve the problem. the takeaways show up to the conversation and be a part of the solution. butte bagels owners cole thomas and eric rankin who had spoken up at a recent council meeting expressing their concerns about housing and hinting at organizing a possible fourth of july elk avenue business strike hosted the may 26 community meeting. both thomas and rankin noted that over the past couple weeks since they d had the opportunity to learn about what the town and regional partners across the county are currently working on regarding affordable housing see crested butte news article the affordable housing conundrum what s out there and what s coming soon in the gunnison valley from may 28 issue . we got totally schooled. the town is working super hard said thomas who emphasized that a fourth of july strike was no longer on the table. but he pointed out that folks have to show up to town meetings to advocate for change this turnout tonight is way bigger than a council meeting said thomas. rankin agreed we as a town have to come to council meetings and present these ideas he said. several members of crested butte town staff town council and mt. crested butte town council attended the meeting and helped provide information and answer questions about what s happening in the valley to create more affordable housing. they also encouraged folks to continue the conversation at upcoming events including the town picnic on june 4 at rainbow park the next town council meeting on june 7 through zoom and a gunnison valley community forum focusing on the housing crisis on june 9 at the cb center for the arts. shifting the conversation attendees agreed that the conversation needs to shift from complaining about the issue to working together to find solutions. additionally folks agreed the community mentality around affordable housing needs to be more inclusive to all crested buttians local workers business owners part time residents second homeowners etc. solving the housing crisis is in everyone s best interest someone pointed out as finding a solution that allows local employees to live here will help our local businesses thrive and will also allow for visitors and second homeowners to enjoy this place to its fullest and for property values and short term rental revenues to stay at desirable levels . many in the crowd also emphasized that second homeowners are not the enemy many go out of their way to rent their homes long term to locals regularly patronize local establishments and donate to local non profits. rather than pointing fingers educating them would be more productive. many restaurant employees talked about putting up signs or banners explaining the reason for short staffing longer waits and decreased business hours was due to lack of housing and encouraging donations to the valley housing fund. if we say we need your help vs. you need to help us that s calling on them that s giving them a choice said thomas. we need your help to preserve this beautiful community therefore we need a little bit of money each year to help protect your investment. you ve invested in this valley you ve invested in every restaurant by owning property here. every single thing that you ve put into the valley you re going to get out of it. many in the crowd supported the idea of coordinating a business spirit week and fundraising event this summer to help educate visiting part time homeowners and visitors and raise awareness and funds for affordable housing. brainstorming solutions other suggestions that came up included temporarily lifting restrictions on homeowners renting their yards or driveways so locals being pushed out of housing had a place to camp or designating a space in town for locals to temporarily camp as they search for housing. some attendees expressed concerns about the new designated camping rules that will make it more difficult for locals that typically rely on camping for housing during the summer. short term rentals str were a popular topic as well and folks suggested lowering the cap on strs in town offering tax incentives to homeowners who rent to locals putting a moratorium on strs or even prohibiting strs altogether. another idea was to update str licenses to require that homeowners rent certain months of the year to locals for example rent to locals for nine months of the year and utilize the other three months for short term rentals. mt. crested butte council member lauren koelliker suggested that folks reach out to homeowners with strs to see what it would take for them to house a local and switch their str to a long term rental. as far as possible taxes prior to the pandemic the crested butte town council had discussed the possibility of an empty house tax or community preservation fee which would charge a tax on strs or houses that sit empty most of the year in which the funds would go toward the town s affordable housing fund. others thought a fund similar to 1 for open space could be started with the revenue going to affordable housing opportunities. what eric and cole have done is super impressive. there s so much money and effort going into this but there s a lot of context said cb town council member will dujardin. i encourage everyone to continue these conversations. the housing crisis forum is on june 9 from 6 to 8 at the center for the arts and the community is invited to come with thoughts concerns and questions about upcoming affordable housing projects and developments.

sport,"a talented and deep senior class propelled the warriors to the second round of the gisa class aaa playoffs in 2020. fast forward to this summer and the warriors are trying to piece together a roster that will look much differently in 2021. brookwood returns six seniors to a squad that finished 8 4 last year. brookwood s rising senior class includes strong beverly collin clark charles knox kelton lewis jack saussy and thomas vick. the team is two months away from its season opener at wewahitchka fla. it is an important summer for a team that will be largely dependent on underclassmen. we were able to get started that first week of june and we hit it running boggs said. we ve done a bunch of strength and speed stuff a ton of position specific stuff. we ve thrown against pelham. we ve thrown in the florida state tournament. we ve thrown at the wakulla tournament. there s a lot of stuff still out there throughout the summer. we ll certainly have a lot of sophomores and juniors and a few freshmen competing for jobs. all of this work is a tremendous opportunity for them to get better. with a smaller roster i am pleased with how many guys we re capable of getting into a game right now at least with what we re doing. brookwood s departed class of 10 seniors included mostly skilled position players. clark s return anchors a linebacking corps that lost three starters. on offense the warriors must find a capable replacement at quarterback for dallas forsyth. the warriors are expected to turn the reins over to rising sophomore rodge waldrop. the bulk of the offensive experience is in the trenches. the warriors return three starters but had multiple players start at some point during the year. mary rose tolbert passed away june 13 2021 after a lengthy period of declining health. she was born in bedford england on march 11 1943. she dedicated herself to raising three boys who she loved completely. she was a talented cook and baker and enjoyed sports the outdoors fishing a . mrs. helen t. flowers 79 of seale al passed away monday june 14 2021 at her home. a funeral service will be held at 2 00 pm est wednesday june 16 2021 at vance brooks funeral home in phenix city al with rev. brady baird and rev. sammie turner officiating. the family will receive fr . dorothy eleanor mercer passed away on june 9 2021 at archbold memorial hospital. she was born on december 18 1932 in pavo to the late early byrd wood and to the late nellie deen wood. she was married to eugene mercer who precedes her in death. survivors include her children leon david mc .

disaster,"waldport the southern portion of lincoln county s ability to handle a potential drought this summer and the potential transfer of the county s jurisdiction of a portion of crestline drive to the city of waldport were among the topics discussed monday evening june 7 during a joint meeting of representatives from the county and waldport. hosted by doug hunt lincoln county commission chair meeting attendees included commissioner kaety jacobson sheriff curtis landers counsel wayne belmont and sheriff s office lt. waldport mayor greg holland councilors jerry townsend sue woodruff greg dunn jayme morris and rick booth and city manager dan cutter attended the virtual meeting representing the city of waldport. jacobson spearheaded the discussion about shared water resources and the strong possibility that weather conditions will force the county to soon declare drought conditions. she spoke of an informal county drought committee that has been meeting weekly since the end of last month composed of local stakeholders from forest and wildlands agriculture state agencies such as fish and wildlife and others. she shared a somewhat foreboding update from a meeting of the drought committee held earlier in the day . the recommendation from the group today was to meet again next week and pull in all of our local water purveyors including cities and smaller water purveyors and small water districts to basically get them ready to dust off their curtailment plans and be ready to implement jacobson said. if things continue the way they are predictions say you ll likely need to declare a drought sometime in the next two to three weeks. jacobson added that in preparation county administration has a drought declaration ready to go when conditions warrant it and the county is working with local water suppliers to get them ready for an impending declaration. during a discussion led by the county s public works director roy kinion the county appeared to be more than willing to transfer a portion of crestline drive currently outside of city limits from lincoln county to the city of waldport. that could come after a sidewalk project paid for via an oregon safe route to school grant that will construct sidewalks near waldport middle and high and crestview heights schools. i think we re really hoping that we can partner now with the county to do a kind of at the end of the project do a cleanup and turnover to the city which usually involves some repaving and doing some base work and some other work that will allow us to realize some savings on the grant which allows us to both extend the sidewalk and potentially actually include some of the sewer line in part of that project cutter said. kinion was agreeable to the suggestions but noted that similar jurisdictional transfers must clear substantial red tape before they re executed. i m on board for trying to work something out there kinion said. we have done some jurisdictional transfers recently. when holland spoke of the waldport city council s recent achievements he spoke glowingly of obtaining the safe routes to school grant and shifting the waldport heritage museum to the alsea bay historic interpretive center potentially opening as early as july 1. woodruff added that wave broadband recently brought high speed internet to the area. actually we have converted and it s cheaper than what we were paying for less speed before woodruff said. not only that now with some competition peak internet has also joined so we now have two purveyors of broadband service which is great for all of our families. holland noted the city s looming infrastructure issues specifically with its water system are the greatest challenges the city faces in the next five years. our biggest problems are with infrastructure related to the water tank and to the treatment facility which are going to need upgrading to meet deq department of environmental quality and other federal regulations holland said. so that s going to be our biggest worry in the coming years and we re trying to make funding for that available. we estimate that it s going to be about 20 million in the next five years. holland said he anticipates an increase in the near future in city utility rates and the city receiving loans and grants to fund water system improvement projects ahead. also during the hour long meeting jacobson praised the waldport community after she revealed zip code data that indicated that as of early this week percent of eligible waldport residents received at least one covid 19 vaccine shot.

labour,"koln the department of transportation is awarding lincoln with an almost million federal transit grant and all of that money is heading to the city s bussing system. with this grant lincoln s startran will get 3 brand new electric buses and two new charging stations. these new electric buses will replace three 2006 diesal buses. the company says this grant will ultimately help the environment and the thousands of people who use lincoln s bus system everyday. these buses give off little to no emissions which startran says makes them healthier for the city and provides a more quiet and smoother ride for passengers. according to startran these new electric buses go hand in hand with lincoln s climate action plan. the city was able to purchase its first electric buses a couple years ago upgrading the bus system to be more sustainable. now startran tells us using this grant to take three diesel ones off the road will help even more. electric buses do cost more initially so having this grant offset the initial cost will bring a lower cost overall when looking at the total bus life cycle said mike davis startran transit manager. having new buses does reduce breakdowns and that improves reliability overall. that s an improvement for passengers and the system as a whole he added. the company said these electric buses require lower maintenance and should last between 12 and 16 years. in the next five years startran will continue to work toward having all electric buses or using alternative fuel options. the new electric buses should make their way to lincoln roads within the next nine months to a year. to spot them you can look for the new green scheme with a yellow cord painted on the side. the company is also hiring for more information click here.

lifestyle,"with the summer on its way our thoughts inevitably turn to holidays. but with covid still holding sway dare we leave cyprus alix norman asks whether its vacation or staycation time . summer is here and with it a 40 year old question posed by the clash. with populations vaccinating at top speed green passes coming into effect and more than a year of lockdowns behind us we re all asking just one thing should i stay or should i go . last year was a total wash out in terms of foreign travel. and though cyprus may be the ideal vacation spot what wouldn t your foreign relatives give right now to be soaked in sunshine rather than rain we all need a break from this purported paradise once in a while. we asked four inveterate travellers and one travel expert whether we ll be eschewing the staycation for a proper vacation this summer in short will we stay or will we go . go says 50 something radio presenter and producer saskia. i ve been in cyprus for over a year now and i have a bad case of islanditis i can t wait to get on an aeroplane and i ve already booked my summer flights first to sunderland for an academic conference and then to the netherlands to see my daughter who s studying abroad. nicosia based saskia who has travelled to almost 50 countries and once owned a travel company in south africa is currently waiting for her second vaccine and looking forward to her august trip. there s such a positive excitement to having something planned. my flights and accommodation are already paid for albeit with extra travel insurance just in case last year i lost more than a few tickets thanks to the measures and to be honest it s cheaper to holiday abroad at the moment. with the lack of visitors i don t know why the local hotels aren t reducing their prices over july and august i can get a 5 star vacation and flights abroad for the same cost as a week in a hotel here . stay says 75 year old widower socrates. why because i still don t think it s safe to travel especially at my age with underlying health conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. even though he s already had both his vaccines and is a lifelong travel devotee socrates has decided to make the most of his larnaca location this year. i ve got my own pool the beach is right there i ll manage he says wryly. before covid i d take several vacations a year i ve been to every continent except antarctica and i love to travel especially on cruises. but though i can t wait to see the world again it s still too early to be truly safe he maintains. while socrates is aware that many luxury cruise liners are now operating out of limassol he s not yet ready to set sail. but vasilis stamataris the president of the association of cyprus travel agents suggests that global cruise companies now sailing out of limassol offer a viable holiday option this summer. during covid some large cruise liners moored off cyprus he explains. since the measures have eased they ve launched new routes in the region. this is great he says for foreign visitors retired americans or brits who are always looking for new adventures. but it also offers locals the opportunity for a unique experience and we re seeing a few bookings from residents this summer. vasilis also notes that vacation reservations through travel agents have increased as locals seek professional guidance on where and how to holiday. if you re booking your holiday online you may fall foul of changing restrictions he notes. we ve noticed that potential travellers are turning instead to their travel agents for a safe effortless experience. bookings have been up since early may he adds with holidays to greece the most popular closely followed by european destinations such as prague austria and germany. elisabeth plans to visit switzerland this summer. an inveterate adventurer and travel blogger who left cyprus 23 times in 2019 she s been feeling the bite of restrictions. but though she s journeyed the world it s home that calls her heart on her first trip abroad in months switzerland is my other home and both my children are there. and it was the last place i visited before the lockdown too. although elisabeth has not yet booked her flights i will as soon as i know that there s no more quarantine in switzerland she s not worried. i m not taking any special precautions because flights can be changed so easily these days. but after the pandemic i ll never take travel for granted again she adds. i m incredibly grateful i will get to see my family this summer you have no idea how much i m looking forward to this trip . those however who were caught abroad when the pandemic began have had quite enough of travel for the time being. 40 year old policy advisor costa plans on staying put all summer. last year while everyone in cyprus was enjoying summer at the beach we were stuck in melbourne in the world s longest and strictest lockdown . we were finally able to return to the island in october he adds just when australia opened up and cyprus went into a series of lockdowns. i reckon we ve spent most of the last 14 months on near house arrest a nightmare with three young kids two of whom spent the better half of their first and second years on this planet in lockdown . this year costa and family will be holidaying in their villa in protaras and spending a few weekends with the

religion,"i come from a long line of freedom loving religious nonconformists. i can trace my lineage back to swiss anabaptists who fled europe for pennsylvania in the late 1600s and i grew up in an unaffiliated congregation in the same commonwealth 300 years later working and worshiping under the certain belief that god had endowed me with certain inalienable rights. i ve also spent my adult life ministering in churches descended from english baptists whose exact relationship to continental anabaptist groups is best left to historians . today i live in virginia where thomas jefferson drafted the 1777 virginia statute for religious freedom that eventually gave us the religious liberty clause of the first amendment a proposal spurred in part by virginia s state sanctioned persecution of baptists. despite this pedigree i find myself perplexed by my fellow baptists who seem to think that our soul liberty the belief that the individual is directly responsible to god in all matters of faith and conscience stands opposed to our communal responsibilities. during the pandemic for example tension between individual rights and the common good emerged as religious liberty issues. when civil authorities placed limits on large gatherings including church worship services baptistic pastors like john macarthur cited soul liberty and local church autonomy as their reasons for opposing such measures. but another more pressing question about independence confronts the messengers of the southern baptist convention this week as they gather for the annual meeting in nashville. in early 2019 houston chronicle special investigation detailed detailed how sexual predators used the autonomy of sbc affiliated churches to prey on members moving from church to church to escape accountability. at the time sbc leaders like russell moore and then sbc president j. d. greear called for structural changes including the formation of a database of known predators. others like former sbc executive committee vice president and general counsel augie boto opposed such measures suggesting that the autonomous nature of baptist churches would itself make such changes impossible. and in recently released audio from an october 2019 debriefing of the caring well conference ronnie floyd president and ceo of the sbc executive committee objected to the public discussion of a mishandled abuse case suggesting that it would disturb the base. in some churches such matters could be left to denominational heads to sort out freeing the base from the supposed unseemliness of it all. but how does the conversation change when a church tradition is built on the democratization of power how does responsibility shift when the people in the pew are the ones in authority instead of protecting the base from such difficult conversations baptist polity actually draws them in. so while it is true that the majority of southern baptists don t know the names of convention leaders and employees it is also true that the majority of southern baptists deeply value the autonomy and individual freedom they enjoy through voluntary association. baptists believe church authority resides in individual members filled with the holy spirit. that is precisely why those same members or in floyd s words the base cannot pass the buck. to forgo the responsibilities of autonomy while taking its privileges would multiply injustice upon injustice. all of this has implications for the work sbc messengers must do in nashville this week. as representatives of their own individual churches the messengers might be tempted to excuse themselves from the larger questions facing the convention including claims that key leaders mishandled abuse and even harassed and belittled survivors. but to forgo responsibility for these matters would be to deny core tenants of baptist doctrine and polity. as sex abuse survivor and advocate rachael denhollander puts it the sbc s theology of autonomy and representative based structure is intended to create a system with extra accountability where power isn t concentrated in a few but rather placed on the consciences of all. in many ways the history of baptist polity runs parallel to the history of modern democratic ideals. civil values like individual freedom the right to vote and local representation find religious parallel in soul liberty congregationalism and local church governance. ideas that would have been radical in any other time radical enough to get you kicked out of 17th century europe for example are today the hallmark of american religious life. but to understand the responsibility that the base will have in nashville we have to understand the relationship between power and accountability. in a given community whether family church or nation a person s responsibility is proportionate to the power they hold in it. the greater power you wield the more responsible you are to wield it for the well being of others especially for those who do not have power to protect themselves. this dynamic is why it s particularly shameful for those with power to act the coward. it is one thing when the weak can do little in the face of corruption. it is another thing when the powerful choose to do nothing and instead turn their energies and attention to consolidating their own power. conversely this privilege responsibility dynamic is also why it s particularly heroic when those without power commit themselves to fighting evil and pursuing systemic change risking what little they have for the good of all. ultimately resisting evil does not depend on having a certain structure or polity. it depends on the moral choices of those within the structure and polity. andy rowell a professor of ministry leadership at the historically baptist bethel university makes a related observation. when teaching seminary students to navigate polity and power in congregations and denominations he commented i emphasize that a structure cannot make up for bad character. even the ideal system will fail without compassion collaboration oversight wisdom sobriety and experimentation. so while members are not individually responsible for the sins of others we are responsible for how we respond to those sins. we are responsible for what we do when they come to light. even if we lack the power to bring about justice on our own we must stand on the side of justice. because while particular leaders may be guilty of particular sins the choices of the individuals around them determine whether these sins go unchallenged. in this respect we need not be actively engaged in corruption to be complicit with it. we simply have to do nothing when we learn of it. we simply have to look the other way. neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim writes nobel laureate and holocaust survivor elie wiesel. silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented. within baptist polity members are responsible for those we entrust with power those we authorize to work on our behalf. we are responsible to select good leaders and we are responsible to hold them accountable to use their power well. reporting on the work of the executive committee in their plenary session today kate shellnutt summarized public comments from the committee s secretary joe knott who opposes widening investigations of abuse cases. knott believes such a move would challenge church independence and suggests that sbc churches are safe from abuse because sunday schools are run by kids mothers and grandmothers. but our baptist commitment to soul liberty and local church autonomy means greater structural accountability not less. leaders like knott who refuse to take the steps necessary to ensure transparency must be removed. it s up to the individual messengers to ensure this happens. whether the person in the pew can carry this kind of moral and ethical weight is the purview of philosophers. that we do carry it is the reality of baptist polity. in a recent interview gladys sicknick mother of slain capitol police officer brian sicknick raises a crucial question for all who enjoy the benefits of individual liberty whether political or soul. after decrying congressional leaders for their response to the january 6 attack she asks do they really want to live in the country they re creating do they want their children to grow up like this sicknick understands what too many of us seem to have forgotten including those who champion soul liberty and local church autonomy. we are right now in real time creating the world that we live in. what we consent to what we allow is who we are. and the choices we make today will birth the communities and churches our children inherit tomorrow. may god grant the base wisdom and virtue this week in nashville. may they steward both the privileges and the responsibilities of membership well.

talks at the captain cook hotel in anchorage alaska on march 18 2021. fredrick j. brown pool afp via getty images . in early june chinese leader xi jinping created a sensation when he urged officials to create a more lovable china. as reported by state news agency xinhua the country must make friends extensively unite the majority and continuously expand its circle of friends with those who understand and are friendly to china. since chinese diplomacy in recent years has been decidedly undiplomatic foreign media speculated that this heralded a change in policy. could this mean the end of wolf warrior diplomacy . the term wolf warrior derived from two jingoistic films wolf warrior and wolf warrior two in which chinese special forces operatives fight on behalf of the world s downtrodden was a huge hit in china though not elsewhere. while the films broke box office in china foreign critics were not so kind with one review opining that wolf warrior two s sheer moral ineptitude combined with its throwback b movie tone makes it one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of the year. admirable though belligerent behavior by soldiers on a mission to help oppressed humanity may be they had not won china many friends when practiced by the country s diplomats. although there are many previous instances of chinese diplomats being rude the opening salvo in the current era occurred in june 2010 when then foreign minister and now state councillor yang jiechi angrily informed asean that china is a big country and you are small countries and that is a fact. a succession of other incidents followed in language that more resembled the trash talk of wrestling matches than traditional diplomatic discourse. when a canadian reporter asked her country s foreign minister about china s detention of canadian citizens wang yi yang jiechi s successor as chinese foreign minister broke in with what the new york times called a withering lecture delivered with operatic dudgeon in which he called the journalist arrogant and prejudiced. eduardo bolsonaro the son of brazil s president and himself a congressman was excoriated for referring to chinese espionage. xijin chief editor of chinese state owned tabloid global times talks about a china taiwan war in beijing china on sept. after the australian government asked for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic hu xijin editor of beijing s global times commented that australia is a bit like chewing gum stuck on the sole of china s shoes. sometimes you have to find a stone to rub if off. in sweden internationally regarded as a neutral observer of world affairs whose citizens are slow to anger ambassador gui congyou became the poster child for wolf warriorism. he and his staff so regularly disparaged the country s media and public officials that he was summoned by the swedish foreign ministry more than 40 times in two years. in an expression that quickly became as infamous as yang jiechi s china is big you are small phrase gui stated we china treat our friends with fine wine but for our enemies we have shotguns. questioned later about the comment gui remarked that despite his talk of shotguns sweden is not important enough to threaten. after the five eyes an intelligence sharing group comprising australia britain canada new zealand and the united states criticized the arrest of hong kong democracy advocates a chinese ministry of foreign affairs official warned that whether they have five or 10 eyes they should be careful about having their eyes poked out and characterized the grouping as a coalition of white anglo saxon supremacists. warnings that wolf warrior tactics were backfiring into the formation of a coalition hostile to china seemed to provoke them into escalating. in march li yang china s consul general in rio de janeiro referred to canadian prime minister justin trudeau as a boy whose greatest achievement is to have ruined the friendly relations between china and canada and have turned canada into a running dog of the us. the chinese embassy in france responded to complaints by saying if there is a wolf warrior diplomacy it is because there are too many mad some people want china s diplomacy to be lamb diplomacy which is more tolerant and calm toward external attacks. in april australia was back in the news with general jin yinan saying that the country was neither strong nor powerful we don t need to take it seriously adding that white supremacy was a key motivator in its actions. in may a cartoon tweeted by the chinese embassy in japan showing the grim reaper with the israeli flag on his scythe caused a furor. after protests by the israeli embassy the tweet was removed but the embassy issued no apology. hopes that xi jinping s admonition to make china more lovable were not accompanied by a softening of rhetoric. on the contrary france s outspoken ambassador lu shaye described himself as wearing the epithet proudly and vowed to stand firm against mad dogs that attack china. nor was there a suspension of belligerent activity. china has stepped up its incursions into southeast asia causing protests in malaysia in june as the country s air force scrambled jets to intercept chinese aircraft entering its national airspace. the philippines has complained about the presence of chinese coast guard ships in the philippines exclusive economic zone with china responding that the area is within the 9 dash line it claims in the south china sea a claim that the permanent court of arbitration in the hague has ruled invalid. this so infuriated philippine foreign secretary teodoro teddy locsin jr. that he sent a tweet calling china an ugly oaf and telling it to get the f k out. admonished by his president for using language that only the president himself could use locsin later apologized for this choice of words although not the substance of his comments. according to the japanese defense ministry as of the beginning of june chinese coast guard vessels were seen in japanese contiguous zones for a record 112 days so far this year. in mid june 28 chinese air force planes entered taiwan s air defense identification zone exceeding the previous record of 25 only two months before. separately chinese ground troops and the navy held a series of exercises featuring vehicle and amphibious landing ships. philippine coast guard personnel survey several ships believed to be chinese militia vessels in sabina shoal in the south china sea in a handout photo distributed by the philippine coast guard on may 5 and taken according to a source on april 27 2021. philippine coast guard handout via reuters . beijing has responded to any criticism with shrill rhetoric assertions that china is being bullied by other states and that it will defend to the end its principled claims accompanied by increased military pressure and economic coercion. these are occasionally leavened by admonitions to the need to find ways to get along that are not accompanied by any conciliatory words or deeds that might provide grounds for diluting what has become a toxic mix. at least up to the present wolf warriors seem to be succeeding. the tough rhetoric is popular domestically and the countries that should be forming a coalition to counter chinese aggression have so far proved themselves unable to do so. some nascent efforts can be seen the blue dot network of australia japan and the united states aims to provide an alternative to china s transnational infrastructure belt and road initiative bri the european parliament has suspended the ratification of the comprehensive agreement of investment cai that had seemed all but assured and the world bank has declined to award the contract for a trans pacific cable to a chinese company but these steps may be too little and too late. parsing xi jinping s words more carefully the image of a more lovable china he held forth did not involve acts of kindness but was actually an admonition to his public relations aka propaganda apparatus to tell china s story better. in other words there should be more stories of tibetans singing and dancing in order to counter foreign accounts of tibetan buddhists self immolating to protest religious oppression photographs of rosy cheeked uyghur maidens reaping bountiful harvests rather than western videotapes of gaunt residents who live in high walled prison compounds and hong kong residents praising the stability the chinese communist party has brought to their city rather than videos of the police beating pro democracy dissidents and a leading newspaper editor being led away in handcuffs. thus far the momentum would seem to be with china. june teufel dreyer is a professor of political

weather,"introduction revolutionary judgment for multinationals in all sectors . last week a revolutionary climate change judgment was rendered with potentially great impact on companies worldwide especially on their environmental footprint policy. in a judgment against royal dutch shell rds dated 26 may 2021 for the first time in history a court has handed down a judgment that holds a multinational company directly responsible for climate change on the basis of a duty of care following from international treaties such as the un guiding principles and paris climate agreement. rds has the obligation to reduce its group s co2 emissions with 45 to meet their reduction goals to prevent climate change. notwithstanding any possible appeal with the foundation of this judgment being in international treaties this judgment is anticipated to be a further catalyst for the current and future wave of climate change litigation against multinational companies in the netherlands and most likely also in other jurisdictions. this judgment does not only affect the oil and gas industry but also other companies in their production or logistic processes. the claim foundation involved milieudefensie already announced actions against dutch companies in other sectors such as steel producers dairy companies and the beef industry. dutch climate change litigation wave urgenda case based on human rights as crowbar . a dutch climate change litigation wave has reached the court rooms since the netherlands is also frontrunner in holding a national government accountable for reducing emissions. earlier on 20 december 2019 the dutch supreme court ruled in the landmark case urgenda foundation v the netherlands that the dutch government must reduce emissions immediately in line with its human rights obligation. the pressure group urgenda urgent agenda used article 2 right to life and article 8 right to family life of the european convention on human rights to bring a claim against the dutch government on the basis that there was a real and imminent threat that required the state to take precautionary measures. the supreme court confirmed decisions of the two lower courts namely that the dutch government was acting unlawfully by failing to pursue a more ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and that it must reduce emissions emitted in the netherlands by at least 25 by the end of 2020. this urgenda case is used as crowbar in further international climate change litigation. supported by the argumentation of this urgenda judgment greenpeace summoned the government before the court with request to require more climate safeguards in government funding of dutch airline klm in november 2020. it was and still is food for discussion if treaties between countries can result in obligations for companies. at the end of may 2021 in a landmark judgment rds was ordered by the district court of the hague to cut its global carbon emissions by 45 by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. this was the result of a collective legal action brought by friends of the earth netherlands milieudefensie together with 17000 co plaintiffs and six other organisations. according to milieudefensie the company needs to contribute to the prevention of dangerous climate change via the corporate policy it determines for its group and its entire value chain on basis of a duty of care. this duty of care was substantiated with human rights articles 2 and 8 of the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedom echr and soft law instruments such as the un guiding principles on business and human rights ungp . the court ruled that rds was responsible for its overall group policy and needs to observe a certain duty of care regarding emissions and climate change policies. the court ruled that milieudefensie could not invoke the human rights under the echr directly but in interpreting the specific duty of care applicable in this context the court followed the ungp. the court concluded that the group s policy is most likely insufficient to meet the 45 reduction standard. since the violation of the unwritten standard of duty of care is clear a court order has been granted that rds must comply with the reduction standards by 2030. at the moment of writing rds announced that it probably will appeal. rds emphasized that it takes all reasonable efforts to be co2 neutral in 2050 but that it now needs to speed up this process. vereniging milieudefensie ors v royal dutch shell plc c 09 571932 ha za 19 379 is a turning point in history it is the first time a judge has ordered a large corporation to comply with the paris climate agreement and it will have major consequences for other companies by forcing them to play their part in tackling the climate emergency. the oil company s sustainability policy was found to be insufficiently specific by the dutch court and it was told it owed a duty of care. this unprecedented ruling will have wide implications for the energy industry as well as for multinational companies in other sectors. sustainability awareness and risk management against threat of climate change litigation . this climate change judgment is a precedent and firm basis for further climate change litigation against multinational companies in the netherlands and in other jurisdictions seeing the foundation in international treaties . in france the environmental organization notre affaire tous is preparing a lawsuit against oil company total on basis of the dutch judgment. the covid 10 crisis already accelerated the focus on sustainability and social responsibility. besides this existing social dynamics result in more public pressure on climate change prevention. companies already need to have a focus on the sustainability perspective in order to keep sympathy of consumers. if the transition process will not go fast enough private enforcement through legislation in court might act as a big stick motivating them to get on the right track. in light of the existing dutch infrastructure for class actions the liberal attitude of the dutch courts with the possibility

labour,"retirement experts estimate that a worker will typically need to save at least 1 million to maintain their standard of living in retirement. however many are far from meeting that goal. according to the federal reserve 25 of adults don t have any retirement savings and only 36 of working americans believe their retirement savings are on the right track. how did the retirement landscape reach this point . a new special on netflix called money explained identifies the rise of defined contribution accounts like 401 k s as one primary reason why it is becoming more challenging for workers to retire with security. during the decades immediately following world war ii if a private sector employer offered a workplace retirement plan that plan usually included a defined benefit pension. in 1978 however congress passed the revenue act which included a section known as the 401 k that drastically changed the practice of retirement planning. the 401 k initially benefited wealthy executives who could defer a portion of their compensation into a savings account tax free. but a man named ted benna who is widely credited with popularizing the 401 k as a retirement savings vehicle theorized that the provision could be used for workers to contribute part of their salary pre tax into a plan as well to try and save for their retirement. while this idea may sound attractive in theory in practice the 401 k has been a disaster for workers retirement security. as we wrote recently the 401 k unlike defined benefit pensions places all the investment and longevity risk on an individual worker. since the investments in a 401 k are not collectively pooled an economic downturn could threaten one s retirement savings. and since there is no guaranteed retirement benefit workers could also risk outliving their savings. the damaging results of the shift from defined benefit pensions to 401 k s can be seen for themselves. the median 401 k balance in one of the largest 401 k providers fidelity investments is only 24500 far from the amount of saving at least 1 million for retirement . and benna himself has spoken out against his creation saying in the netflix series that the 401 k was never intended to be our national retirement system. it s time for america to abandon its unrealistic obsession with 401 k s. pension plans guarantee a secure retirement that workers can count on in their golden years. retirement planning .

unrest,"gaza june 16 reuters israeli aircraft struck hamas sites in gaza on wednesday after incendiary balloons were launched from the palestinian enclave in the first such attacks since a fragile ceasefire ended 11 days of deadly fighting last month. the violence poses an early test for the government of new prime minister naftali bennett whose patchwork coalition came to power on sunday on a pledge to focus on socioeconomic issues and avoid sensitive policy choices towards the palestinians. an egyptian mediated truce that halted fighting between israel and gaza militants did not immediately appear to be threatened by the flare up with the overnight israeli airstrikes giving way to calm by morning. the overnight violence follows a march in east jerusalem on tuesday by jewish nationalists that had drawn threats of action by hamas the ruling militant group in gaza. israel s military said its aircraft attacked hamas armed compounds in gaza city and the southern town of khan younis and was ready for all scenarios including renewed fighting in the face of continued terrorist acts emanating from gaza . the military said the strikes came in response to the launching of balloons laden with incendiary material which the israeli fire brigade reported caused 20 blazes in open fields in communities near the gaza border. a hamas spokesman confirming the israeli attacks said palestinians would continue to pursue their brave resistance and defend their rights and sacred sites in jerusalem. but analysts suggested hamas refrained from firing rockets around the march and after the israeli strikes to avoid an escalation in gaza which was devastated by may s aerial bombardment. the current calm may give the egyptians a chance to try and cement it said talal okal an analyst in gaza. israel s army radio reported that israel had informed egyptian mediators that direct hamas involvement in the balloon launch would imperil long term truce talks. israeli officials did not immediately confirm the report. hours before the overnight strikes thousands of flag waving israelis congregated around the damascus gate of jerusalem s old city before heading to judaism s holy western wall drawing palestinian anger and condemnation. a tree in a field catches fire after palestinians in gaza sent incendiary balloons over the border between gaza and israel near nir am june 152021.
