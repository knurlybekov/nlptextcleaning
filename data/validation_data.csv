arts,"on 31 march two of classical music s most accomplished and well known artists maxim vengerov and evgeny kissin performed a duo recital programme at the dubai opera house as part of the cc forum marking their inaugural performance together since first meeting at the opening ceremony of the renowned tchaikovsky competition in 1986. the concert featured music by brahms kreisler rachmaninoff and contemporary american maltese composer alexey shor in an ambitious albeit temporary return to concert activities in the united arab emirates uae . grammy award winning maxim vengerov is widely regarded as one of the finest violinists in the world a child prodigy who would win first prize in the junior wieniawski competition in poland at the age of ten before later going on to secure first place in the carl flesch international violin competition at the age of fifteen. he has toured extensively across the globe and recorded for numerous prestigious labels including teldec and emi as well as following in the footsteps of his former mentor mstislav rostropovich embarking on a successful and in demand career as a conductor in addition to his soloist activities. maxim vengerov is the recipient of numerous awards in recognition of his career including a classical brit award two gramophone awards five edison classical music awards two echo awards and a world economic forum crystal award. an album recording followed soon afterwards as well as numerous international tours including japan the usa and europe. he is recipient of the 1991 musician of the year prize from the chigiana academy of music in siena as well as two of the russian federation s highest cultural honours the triumph and shostakovich awards. the concert was no less than one would expect from these titans of classical music their performance an engaging and powerful one that provided a perfect cadence to the day s proceedings. beginning with an offering from contemporary composer alexey shor the pair deftly gave life to the work s subject vengerov s shimmering vibrato soaring gracefully over kissin s soft enunciations and delicate pedalling the ensemble timbre effectively and imaginatively evoking shor s lonely sail. the unexpected diminished tonality shortly before the end of the work was handled masterfully this perhaps otherwise small detail in the hands of other performers transformed into a startling and tender revelation that was breathtaking in its effectiveness. i later asked the performers about their experience performing this work by mr shor someone who is a relatively new figure in the world of classical music and who in a remarkably short space of time has achieved considerable success his works having been performed in such venues as carnegie hall wigmore hall and the mariinsky theatre amongst many others and by many noted performers including salvatore accardo ray chen denis kozukhin and andreas ottensamer. shor s works have been performed numerous times in malta notably including jester s wedding an ice show based on his popular crystal palace ballet as well as past appearances at the inclassica malta international music festival. in particular i was interested to learn of the duo s approach to interpreting the work noting the composer s unabashed neo romantic leanings compared insightfully to film music by evgeny kissin despite being a product of the twentieth and twenty first centuries. yes he s not one of those avant garde composers certainly maxim vengerov explains. he writes beautiful melodies and his work is full of imagination it s very picturesque. almost all of his works they have names so when you play this piece lonely sail for example it really feels like that and so we tried to bring out these colours. he s very talented and it s fascinating to know that he is someone who became a composer quite lately and he s doing quite well i think you ll agree . this piece and i suppose much of alexey s work could be likened to film music. the key thing there is that the music matches or rather reinforces the themes and messages on the screen. alexey s music is much the same the title of each piece setting the tone and giving the music something that is narratively very strong to work this case the piece is called lonely sail and i think the name speaks for itself really. evgeny kissin . speaking to members of the audience following the performance it came as no surprise to this writer to hear descriptions such as incredible and amazing frequently voiced with one audience member breathlessly exclaiming that it really felt historic. the professionalism and musical commitment of the pair was effortlessly maintained throughout the performance the subsequent sonata no. 2 in a major by brahms presenting bold yet navigable changes in mood and timbre the pair s playing easily moving between ethereal passages to sterner vertically dense motifs. 1 teemed with joyous and playful abandon presenting a rugged charm that playfully teetered on the edge of stability without ever losing control. rachmaninoff s vocalise closed the concert on a peaceful and appropriately thoughtful note. maxim vengerov and evgeny kissin are two of the greatest artists of our generation and it was a pleasure to work with them and help support their first performance together here in dubai. i also wish to extend my sincere congratulations to american maltese composer alexey shor on his middle east debut an important moment which follows in the footsteps of other leading composers in promoting their culture overseas and introducing their music to new audiences. jorge iglesias one of the concert s organizers. content submitted by samantha pierrie a freelance writer who has a passion for music. in her free time she

crime,"cleveland ohio the judge overseeing the case of a army soldier charged with several counts of murder in a shootout at a 2018 new year s eve party dealt a blow to the prosecution before a second trial set to begin wednesday. cuyahoga county common pleas court judge joan synenberg who ended the first trial last month after declaring a mistrial barred prosecutors from asking one of two key witnesses to identify tevin biles thomas as the shooter in court. she also suppressed biles thomas testimony to the grand jury that was the basis for a perjury charge. the rulings handed down friday mean the state s entire case against biles thomas rests on the words of one witness who testified to avoid a felony conviction and who admitted during the first trial that he didn t see biles thomas shoot. biles thomas faces three counts each of aggravated murder murder and felonious assault in the dec. 31 2018 shooting at an airbnb rental that left devaughn gibson delvaunte johnson and toshaun banks dead. he is also charged with perjury after prosecutors accused him of lying to the grand jury when he testified that he didn t have a gun and he didn t know gibson who was his cousin was dead. prosecutors say that biles thomas opened fire on johnson and banks after they attacked gibson and johnson returned fire. biles thomas killed johnson and banks and johnson killed gibson prosecutors said. a final pre trial hearing is set for tuesday afternoon. synenberg declared a mistrial on may 24 during the third day of jury deliberations following seven days of testimony. someone mixed court briefs in which prosecutors and biles thomas defense attorneys debated whether to allow the jury to consider whether biles thomas acted in self defense with the evidence from the trial given to jurors to use to deliberate. jurors read the documents and told synenberg that they affected their feelings about the case. no physical evidence tied biles thomas to the shooting so investigators relied mainly on the statements of macquise lewis and jozette brown. both gave differing descriptions of the shooter but ultimately came to identify biles thomas based on his clothing in the security video that police showed them. synenberg suppressed brown s identification for the second trial after she initially testified that she never saw the shooter s face and only identified biles thomas as the shooter after seeing his arrest photo in a news story. lewis identified biles thomas as the shooter based on clothing from the surveillance video. he also said under cross examination that he didn t see biles thomas shoot and that he was only saying what other people had told him to say. lewis also testified as part of a plea agreement with cuyahoga county prosecutors where he admitted that he stole johnson s gun from the shooting scene before police arrived and threw it into lake erie. in exchange for his testimony against biles thomas prosecutors reduced a felony tampering with evidence charge that carried a maximum of three years in prison to a misdemeanor. prosecutors also dismissed a felony gun charge that lewis picked up in january 2020 when warrensville heights police arrested him with a gun after his mother accused him of shooting at her house. lewis was free on bond on the tampering with evidence charge at the time. common pleas court judge deborah turner sentenced lewis last week to 14 days of probation. synenberg ordered prosecutors to turn over to her any testimony that lewis may have made to the grand jury in biles thomas case so she could decide whether to let defense attorneys see it. the move is rare as state law requires grand jury proceedings to be kept secret in most cases. synenberg said in court tuesday that she learned after her order from the court reporter s office that lewis did not testify before the grand jury. synenberg previously denied a motion from biles thomas defense attorney joseph patituce to suppress his statements to the grand jury. assistant cuyahoga county prosecutor saleh awadallah brought biles thomas into the grand jury to testify after he asked to speak to his attorney during a police interrogation minutes earlier. awadallah told biles thomas that he knew he asked for his attorney then asked him if he wanted to testify anyway and biles thomas agreed. patituce asked synenberg to reconsider her earlier motion after the first trial where prosecutors read a transcript of biles thomas grand jury testimony. she agreed and then barred prosecutors from using the testimony against him.

economy,"it may be a memecoin but its results are no joke. there has n t been a more divisive cryptocurrency than dogecoin this year. some crypto enthusiasts ca n t stand all the attention it gets compared to more useful coins. others including dogecoin superfan elon musk have put all their support behind it. if there s one positive thing to say about dogecoin it s that it has defied the odds. it was made as a joke and the original creators left the project in 2015. it went years without any meaningful updates. and as many have pointed out it has no unique advantages that make it deserving of special recognition. despite all that a purchase for 10000 of dogecoin two years ago would now be worth well over 1 million. thanks to some staggering price increases in 2021 it has even rocketed its way into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that s based on the doge meme. it has the image from the meme a shiba inu dog as its logo. two software engineers billy markus and jackson palmer launched dogecoin on dec. they created it as a satire of other coins and all the hype those cryptocurrencies were getting. dogecoin quickly amassed a cult following that saw it as a fun alternative to bitcoin. the dogecoin community has grown over the years especially as the price has gone up. however markus and palmer both decided to leave the dogecoin project in 2015. a new development team would later take over dogecoin and they recently revealed they ve been working with elon musk since 2019. the coin went mainstream this year in no small part because of all the times musk sent dogecoin prices soaring. and after years where many did n t even know where to buy dogecoin it s now available on several of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. how dogecoin has grown . two years ago dogecoin cost less than a penny on june 6 2019 . at that price 10000 would be enough to purchase about million dogecoin. by that same date this year dogecoin had a price of the same number of dogecoin would now be worth just over million for a return of almost 12000 . that s just one example of dogecoin s growth but it has had higher highs and lower lows. here are more of the notable price points it has hit over the years . dogecoin s earliest recorded price on coinmarketcap is on dec. if you decided to throw 10000 on it back then you d have bought nearly 18 million dogecoin worth over million. when crypto had its first big bull market dogecoin followed suit. its price reached in january 2018. however it quickly fell back below and would n t cross that threshold again for almost three years. thanks to a steady stream of tweets from elon musk dogecoin became one of the most successful coins so far in 2021. it hit an all time high of almost on may 8 2021. it s important to note that even though dogecoin has grown considerably recent results have n t been nearly as impressive. since that all time high on may 8 it has lost over half its value. dogecoin is fun and it has delivered huge returns before but neither of those things makes it a sound investment. when investing in crypto the best strategy is to look for coins with long term value. instead of just focusing on how popular a coin is at the moment consider what competitive advantages it has or the problems it s trying to solve. those are areas where dogecoin falls short. it does n t have anything that makes it unique compared to other coins. the price has gone up because of its popularity but that s not sustainable. if you ve been thinking about putting in your own money it s important to learn about the dangers of dogecoin and the risk involved. anyone who has held on to dogecoin during its recent gains has likely done very well. it s still not a good idea to bet on lightning striking twice. there s always the slim chance that dogecoin goes to the moon but the more likely outcome is that it ends up one of the crypto fads of 2021. there are hundreds of platforms around the world that are waiting to give you access to thousands of cryptocurrencies. and to find the one that s right for you you ll need to decide what features that matter most to you.

economy,"a deal marks a truce but may not resolve the 17 year old quarrel . it is the longest trade dispute in the history of the world trade organisation wto and its predecessors. america and the european union have been fighting for 17 years over subsidies provided to boeing an american planemaker and its european arch rival airbus. but is an end to the tussle in sight on june 15th amid the hubbub of president joe biden s first trip to europe america and the eu signed an agreement to prevent the dispute and the associated retaliatory measures from escalating into a broader trade war. two days later america and britain where some airbus factories are based agreed on a similar deal. and do the deals really end it . the battle began in 2004 the year after airbus first overtook boeing in aircraft deliveries. america ripped up a previous understanding on subsidies for large civil aircraft manufacturers after boeing complained that its rival unfairly received what grew to become 22bn in repayable launch aid to develop new airliners. airbus and the eu soon hit back with their own claim stating that boeing s commercial operations had benefited from generous military contracts as well as tax breaks worth 24bn. the wto eventually ruled in the two parallel cases that both firms had received illegal subsidies. in 2019 it awarded america the right to slap tariffs worth on european goods. it also gave the eu the right to impose tariffs worth 4bn on american products ranging from planes to harley davidson motorcycles. the dispute has dragged on for two main reasons. the first is the sheer complexity of the case. it has taken the wto much longer to work out whether subsidies robbed each party of aircraft orders than it would have done to rule on the average trade case. this is because the market for airliners is so different from the sort of commodity goods such as steel or aluminium that trade cases are usually fought over. the second was the determination of the two sides to push litigation at the wto as far as possible a sign of how strong the lobbying power of airbus and boeing used to be. a deal only became a serious possibility after the election of joe biden who is keen to strengthen america s alliance with europe in the face of threats from china and russia. both countries have taken advantage of 17 years of bickering between america and europe to dish out subsidies of their own worth tens of billions of dollars helping national champions develop jets to take on airbus and boeing. even so the deal defers the dispute rather than ending it. the retaliatory tariffs arising from the wto litigation will be suspended for five years. state financing on market terms ie broadly on borrowing terms available from private sector lenders for the development and production of airliners will still be allowed while a working group led by american and european trade ministers attempts to reach a final understanding about past and future subsidies. it is a sign that neither side appears to believe that large commercial aircraft can ever be built on fully commercial terms. but the two sides remain far apart on what exactly counts as market terms and what a final agreement on subsidies should look like. without any detailed rules on what handouts are and aren t allowed the efforts of china and russia to build planes to compete with airbus and boeing will continue unhindered this decade. that certainly was not the outcome that america and boeing were seeking when they started the dispute in 2004.

environmental,"the white tiger is produced by a genetic fluke that occurs when two orange tigers with rare recessive forms of a gene called alleles happen to breed. white tigers in the wild are so rare that they have only been seen a handful of times in recorded history with the last known wild white tiger killed in 1958. scientists dispute whether their rarity is because the recessive allele is the result of a one time mutation or because white tigers lack adequate camouflage negatively affecting their ability to stalk prey or avoid other predators. the sad truth though is that white tigers now represent a grossly disproportionate segment of the captive tiger population relative to their prevalence in wild populations. because they are so rare exploitative roadside menagerie operators exhibitors and collectors seek to maintain white tiger populations for the sake of generating profit. to continue producing white tigers captive tigers with this rare allele expression are intensively inbred over multiple generations. in other words parents are bred with their offspring siblings are bred with one another and other closely related animals are bred with one another as well. in fact all of the white tigers in captivity in the are believed to be descendants of a single male bengal tiger named mohan. captured as a cub by a hunting party in 1951 mohan was bred to an orange tiger and then to his daughter from that breeding. this inbreeding resulted in the birth of a tigress named mohini one of two white tigers in the litter of four produced by mohan and his daughter. mohini was gifted to the smithsonian national zoo in 1960 and then bred to her half brother an individual who was also her uncle and then to her son from that litter to create more white tigers. the unscientific practice of continual inbreeding continues to this day not by zoos accredited by the american association of zoos and aquariums aza like the smithsonian national zoo but primarily by largely unregulated commercial enterprises who use white tigers as a draw for paying visitors. more than 60 years since mohan and 11 tiger generations later white tigers are suffering the consequences of extensive inbreeding which has produced tragic results. because of the resultant reduced biological fitness known as inbreeding depression white tiger cubs experience a high rate of neonatal mortality. for intensively inbred animals over 80 percent of cubs pass away shortly after birth. white tigers also experience reduced litter size and shorter average life spans are prone to impaired vision cardiac defects serious spinal and facial deformities and compromised immune systems. in 2011 the aza ended the practice of breeding white tigers citing the abnormal debilitating and at times lethal external and internal conditions and characteristics resulting from breeding wild animals to increase the frequency of rare alleles. pseudosanctuaries exploitative unqualified wildlife exhibits masquerading as legitimate rescue sanctuaries continue to breed and abuse white tigers under the guise of conservation. indeed captive bred white tigers serve absolutely no conservation or education purpose. their lack of genetic diversity high degree of inbreeding and resultant physical afflictions remove these animals and their offspring from consideration for any hypothetical release programs. these animals have no place in any conservation program which explains why no legitimate conservation organization today endorses the breeding of white tigers. the only reason white tigers are bred today is because they are incredibly lucrative for breeders and exhibitors alike who charge visitors at entertainment venues to play with cubs using them as photo props. once cubs used for direct contact displays age out of this vicious pay for play system they may be sold to the general public as pets warehoused intensively bred to create the next generation of money making white tiger cubs or otherwise subjected to inhumane treatment. when the unsuspecting public buys into an exhibitor s false conservation claims and pays to see or handle a white tiger they are unknowingly perpetuating irresponsible inbreeding poor population management and inhumane practices. currently federal legislation has been introduced in the senate including the big cat public safety act 263 s. 1210 striking a blow to the key financial driver behind the incessant and highly unregulated breeding of big cats and the resultant proliferation and breeding to death of white tigers. pop culture has romanticized the keeping and breeding of tigers and other big cats in a terribly harmful way. hopefully our collective eyes are now open to what we need to do to ultimately protect these iconic animals from their greatest threat us.

health,"ap a bipartisan effort to legalize marijuana for medical use in north carolina got a legislative committee hearing on wednesday. but it s unclear whether enough legislators are ready now to alter their views on pot to make it law. with nearly three quarters of states already allowing medical marijuana senators who unveiled their framework told colleagues the measure takes health and safety seriously while offering palliative care for those with painful or life threatening illnesses such as cancer. but views on marijuana have been changing quickly. to some people it is a contentious issue and to some people it is not said senate rules committee chairman bill rabon of brunswick county a bill sponsor and cancer survivor. i think there s nothing less compassionate on this earth than to watch a person you love suffer when there s something that can ameliorate at least that suffering . i think it is time to bring this forward. the legislation would create a new regulatory system in which patients are declared in writing by a physician to have one of several debilitating medical conditions to obtain an id card to purchase or possess marijuana and cannabis infused products. the patients caregivers also could be registered. health conditions would include cancer epilepsy hiv aids crohn s disease post traumatic stress disorder and multiple sclerosis including those suffering nausea related to hospice care. doctors would declare in writing that the potential health benefits of cannabis use for a patient outweigh the risks. recreational use of pot would remain illegal. qualifying patients could obtain medical cannabis products for smoking or other uses through up to 10 suppliers statewide licensed by a new state commission. each supplier would control production from seedlings to sale with up to eight medical cannabis centers from which to sell to the public. suppliers would have to pay 10 of gross revenues monthly to the state department of health and human services. the measure contains safeguards such as an online system for cannabis centers and police to check patient registrations. and suppliers would still be subject to cannabis prosecution if found to be driving while high or delivering cannabis to people who are n t registered. thirty six states currently permit cannabis products for medical use while 18 states and the district of columbia have passed legislation regulate adult use of cannabis according to the national conference of state legislatures. come july 1 in virginia adult residents can legally possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana for use. committee speakers included military veterans who served in the iraq war and suffer with ptsd. they say they know of colleagues who have committed suicide because of the mental anguish that was often treated with pharmaceuticals. i do not seek to get it s not what it s about said josh biddix an ex marine who served in iraq and former asheville and gastonia police officer. he is now a hemp farmer which is lawful in north carolina. but i do seek pain relief and stress relief from anxiety and ptsd without the the plethora of medications. cannabis in my opinion is a lot safer and a lot better alternative than alcohol. the rev. mark creech of the christian action league of north carolina opposed the measure saying that while he was moved by the other speakers the states that offer medical marijuana correlated with locales with higher rates of marijuana addiction. marijuana is not medicine and science has never been conclusive that it is proven safe or effective as other food and drug administration approved medications have creech said. he added that he hoped senators will see through the haze about marijuana s effectiveness. several committee members praised rabon for the measure. some democrats want marijuana use more decriminalized broadly. at least two committee republicans said they were skeptical about medical marijuana. the bill was n t voted upon wednesday and would have to clear four committees before reaching the senate floor and heading to the house if approved. but the gop lawmakers said they could be persuaded. i do have a number of concerns morally and otherwise but i m trying my best to look at this with open eyes and i might be convinced said sen. chuck edwards a henderson county republican.

humanInterest,"i had occasion to look through some old diaries  trying to find the dates of the earliest bee swarms i had encountered. in the process  i came up with another blast from the past. these had to do with outdoors and firearms topics  which was no big stretch  but the good part was they were created during retreats to various secluded locations. this involved a team of writers and technical people  dropped off in environs ranging from isolated camps to remington farms. we were expected to get up early  work intensely for 12 hours  then stop and do something to shake out the cobwebs for a couple hours. these somethings ranged from pontoon boat jousting to goose hunting  depending on where we were. we then ate a huge meal  went to bed  and repeated for five to seven days until we had a product ready for printing. a couple of these  as luck would have it  included only males. these  therefore  included the obligatory messing with each other. one of the most memorable  took place at an isolated camp in the maine northwoods. there were 11 of us in a cabin designed to hold four  meaning seven of us slept on the floor in sleeping bags. there was great debate over who got the only bed behind a closed door  debate quickly quashed by the highest ranking member of the state game warden force. this pulling rank could not go unanswered. the first morning  he emerged carrying a no. 10 can. seems he woke at least once every night at the urgings of his bladder and did not want to try to tiptoe in pitch black through various comatose hulks strewn at random across the floor in order to get to the outhouse. it took a couple days before the idea struck one of us. that night  the can was under his bed in the normal location. however  the bottom had been removed. the bellowing and dancing as he tried to adjust his aim in the stygian darkness was priceless. i traveled with jim norine from the nra and  when we finished the book two days ahead of schedule  jim wanted to spend a day fly fishing one of the wilderness streams nearby. the senior game warden said he knew just the place. we went miles in his 4 wd truck  finally turning to smash straight into a thicket  stopping right on the bank of a river. we were to fish along for a mile or so. when we saw some orange flagging on the bushes  the truck would be waiting. it was great. in the process  i came up with another blast from the past. many moons ago  i was retained by a national organization to write some training manuals. these had to do with outdoors and firearms topics  which was no big stretch  but the good part was they were created during retreats to various secluded locations. this involved a team of writers and technical people  dropped off in environs ranging from isolated camps to

fish along for a mile or so. when we saw some orange flagging on the bushes  the truck would be waiting. it was great. we each took a side and had caught a couple fish when jim began to scream and came charging across  filling his waders and nearly floating his hat. the cause was an irate mother moose  with the hair up on her back. we could retreat no further than the stream bank because of the thick brush  but this worked. she charged to the center of the stream  gave us the evil eye  and went back into the brush where we could see a small calf. i thought that was pretty darned funny  until 50 yards later  another one burst out of the brush on my side  driving us to the other side. this process continued for the entire almost two mile trek. when we came to the flagging and clambered out to the truck  our friend wondered if we had enjoyed our little hike through the puckerbrush. seems he had dumped us out in a major moose calving area. i gave little thought to the term puckerbrush until a reader asked just what species of bush that might be and why it had that name i had given little consideration to the matter  but my old diary contained some entries that shed a bit of light. i am not really sure where the pucker derived. perhaps a reaction to the thought of having to enter the thicket for that is what puckerbrush is an impenetrable tangle of small shrubs. one urban dictionary adds that it is often full of stickers and snakes  not a place anyone would want to go. in our area  while there are occasionally stickers and possibly snakes  in general the thickets are marvelous habitat for things like cottontail rabbits  but also provide nesting habitat for an amazing array of birds  including some of the more rare warblers and other passerines. my driveway is a perfect example of a puckerbrush thicket. i control it only as much as needed to get a vehicle through. my management involves only cutting out invasive species like buckthorn. most common puckerbrush patches contain native species  which  although they can grow aggressively  are not detrimental invasives. the ones we see most extensively are some of the dogwoods and viburnums. the biggest component is often gray dogwood. this woody shrub can get as much as 10 feet tall  but most of it is eye level. the bark is dull gray but  after a profusion of greenish flowers that the bees work extensively  it forms bright white berries borne on vivid red stems. these are eaten by birds  but have varying levels of toxicity for mammals. they were considered a fatal poison for canines. every bit as thick  another dogwood is quite pretty for the entire year. the younger branches of red dogwood  also called red osier dogwood  display that bright color summer and winter. the common name red osier is derived from a french word used to describe long shoots used for basket making and wicker. young stems are useful for basket weaving and less flexible  older stems are prized for basket rims. the stems were also used as skewers and frames for racks to dry berries and salmon  and imparted a nice flavor to the food. in my early life  i found strong  y shaped crotches also made terrific slingshots. deer  rabbits  snowshoe hare  and all sorts of small rodents eat the young stems as a source of winter nutrition. deer trails through the puckerbrush often meander  seemingly without pattern  until you notice they are traveling from red dogwood to red dogwood  with the trail kept open by their incessant pruning. there is one other dogwood in my puckerbrush. the growth is similar to the others  but the berries are dark blue instead of white. these fruits are avidly sought by birds with over 40 species documented using them. the berries have a particularly high fat content  very valuable for building up for the winter or for a long migration south. i noted a lot of red dogwood at the beginning of our hike along the trout stream in maine. later  i was far too busy trying to survive multiple moose encounters. however  the bottomless can prank was so worth it . bob henke writes a weekly outdoors column for the post star. get local news delivered to your inbox .'

plan for back to school costs sports equipment and activity fees. vacations travel weddings and other celebrations may need to be budgeted for as well. it can make sense to trim some costs so you can afford these resurgent expenses. one possibility rotate your streaming services and other subscriptions. these may have sustained you during lockdowns but you could put some on pause now to save money while you continue to enjoy others. perhaps you have more income you re back to work after being unemployed or you re a parent about to get the first of six monthly child tax credit checks from the

forbearance on federal student loans is scheduled to end this fall with monthly payments resuming in october. if those payments would be a hardship contact your lenders to see if income driven repayment plans or other measures would help. if you requested forbearance on your mortgage payment or other debt that has an expiration date as well. debt that s in forbearance isn t forgiven so you ll typically need to plan to make up the payments you missed. check with your lender about your options. flexible savings accounts . congress more than doubled how much employees can contribute to flexible spending accounts for child care in 2021. workers can put in a maximum of 10500 up from 5000 in 2020. the limit for health care fsas remains 2750. this year you re also allowed to make midyear changes to your contributions to either account something that normally requires a change in life circumstances such as marriage or having a child. your employer must opt in to these changes but if it has and you can increase your contributions you could save significantly on taxes. frequent traveler programs . last year airline hotel and rental car companies softened the rules for their loyalty programs to reflect pandemic travel restrictions. many extended the expiration deadlines for points miles and free hotel night certificates. but the pause on expirations won t last forever. check your rewards programs and make plans to use your rewards before they disappear. similarly you may have credits from canceled travel that also will expire if you don t use them. if you can t use those in time request an extension. if you buy your own insurance you may get a better deal on the affordable care act exchanges now that congress has expanded the subsidies reducing costs for most people. if you don t already have aca coverage there s currently a special enrollment period that ends aug. 15. if you get unemployment benefits at any point during 2021 you can qualify for a zero

lifestyle,"since its launch in 2013 chanel s soleil tan de chanel has been hailed a favourite by makeup artists influencers and beauty lovers alike. i discovered it via makeup artist cher webb who waxed lyrical about how it was her favourite product for lending skin a natural sun kissed glow in seconds. fans couldn t get enough of the product s buttery cream formula which blended into the skin seamlessly to create a believable glow not to mention the luxe packaging. then in 2020 chanel updated the cult classic renaming it chanel les beiges healthy glow bronzing cream and horror of horrors changing the formula. beauty bloggers were quick to compare the two products with many noticing that the updated version was lighter and slightly warmer toned. a new ingredient was also added to the mix hydrogenated coconut oil for glide on application. however lots of people have since claimed it clogs pores and aggravates acne prone skin. there were other subtler tweaks too. the chic shallow pot is identical to the original except for a beige instead of gold cc symbol on the lid and it s packaged in a beige rather than black box to match the entire les beiges collection which includes a range of highlighters amazing tinted moisturisers which sadly do not come in a range of inclusive shades and blush sticks. black women and women of colour were particularly disappointed that the updated product yet again came in only one shade bronze universel. we all want a healthy bronzed look whether we re fair or dark skinned so when i tried the bronze universel myself i was disappointed to discover that the shade matched my skin tone exactly and felt more like a bb cream. i m light skinned and while it gave me an overall glow i didn t reap the bronzing benefits. it was clear to me that chanel had not made this product with my dark skinned sisters in mind. we all deserve to be represented in the luxury beauty space and i wasn t alone in calling for chanel to extend its shade range. now the brand is launching a second shade called drum roll please soleil tan deep bronze. the cream gel texture is exactly the same as the original and has a very subtle radiance when you slowly buff it into the skin that famous velvety non sparkly finish. it was a lot easier to work with and more forgiving than i expected. after i applied my skincare spf and foundation i rubbed my kabuki brush over the satisfyingly smooth formula and gently blended it into my cheekbones to give myself a contoured look. it was a lot darker than i anticipated and i realised i d used way too much on the other side of my face i took a lighter approach and built up the coverage instead. i was super pleased with the results. a little goes a long way and it blended beautifully giving me a healthy glow as promised. gallery 15 celeb hairstyles for thin hair prima uk . however i will always have my dark skinned sisters in mind so i called my friend over to test it on her skin. just as the original universel shade blended into my cheeks like a bb cream the soleil tan deep bronze blended into her much darker skin. i could use this as a light foundation in the summer she told me as i buffed the formula into her skin. it did give her a healthy glow and evened out her skin tone but there needs to be a much darker shade in order to achieve a more bronzed look. for now the new bronzer is doable for black women and women of colour if you want to look like you ve stepped off a plane from a week in the south of france. that said chanel will need to be more shade inclusive if they want to convert us to this luxury beauty space. chanel les beiges healthy glow bronzing cream 43 in soleil tan deep bronze pre launches on on 28th june.

political revenge for challenging president vladimir putin s rule said the latest moves against opposition activists reflected the authorities concern about the waning popularity of the main kremlin directed party united russia. khodorkovsky told the associated press in an interview over zoom that the upcoming election is a theatrical performance in which any candidates that the government is n t happy with will simply not be allowed to run. he said that the authorities are increasing repression to stifle any critical voices before the sept. 19 parliamentary election including activists of the open russian movement that he financed. andrei pivovarov the head of open russia that dissolved itself last week was pulled off a warsaw bound plane at st. petersburg s airport just before takeoff

opposition fearing that the september election could trigger protests. the government is afraid of potential protests that could emerge if they cheat too flagrantly khodorkovsky told the ap. they are trying to sanitize the political environment before the election. he added that he would continue to support opposition candidates despite the official pressure. last week pivovarov announced that open russia was shutting down to protect its members from prosecution after russian authorities designated it as undesirable. the government already has outlawed more than 30 groups using a 2015 law that made membership in undesirable organizations a criminal offense. another bill now making its way through parliament increases the punishment for members of those groups. in a letter from custody that his lawyers posted tuesday on pivovarov s instagram account he said there is no cause for joy but i do n t feel despondent. he added there is a plan to put any people with a different view under arrest but such people already are the majority. his lawyers said the charges against pivovarov for assisting an undesirable organization were filed after he declared its closure. amnesty international meanwhile strongly condemned pivovarov s arrest and demanded his release. this is an audacious move by the kremlin in its continued use of the law on undesirable organizations to target and shut down critics said natalia zviagina the director of the group s moscow office. the russian authorities must end reprisals against their political opponents and other critical voices in the country. in march police briefly detained about 200 participants of a forum of municipal council members that open russia helped organize. putin s most determined political foe alexei navalny was arrested in january upon his return from germany where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the kremlin accusations that russian officials reject. he was handed a 2 1 2 year prison sentence in february for violating terms of a suspended sentence stemming from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that he denounced as politically driven. with navalny in prison prosecutors have asked a moscow court to designate his foundation for fighting corruption and his network of regional offices as extremist groups. in a parallel move a bill approved by the lower house of the russian parliament bars members donors and supporters of extremist groups from seeking public office a measure that would keep navalny s associates from running for parliament in september.

religion,"moral intelligence is an issue of cultivation from an early age and it has to be ongoing. getty images istockphoto photo by fizkes getty images istockphoto . in an era where our children s education has become highly politicized and curriculums are shaped not only by teachers but also politicians and social activists it may be important to hit the pause button and return to basics. there has never been a better time to think deeply about how we want to build our children s future based on facts and science rather than subjectivity. in this context i am guessing it was not an accident that i recently opened a book that sits on my study s shelf. this book has remained untouched for two decades. it is one of the most popular books ever written by a distinguished harvard pediatric psychiatrist. it skillfully looks at the science of teaching children values. dr. robert coles the pulitzer prize winning author of the spiritual life of children also authored the book i am talking about a book entitled the moral intelligence of children. coles published more than 1300 articles reviews and essays in newspapers magazines journals and anthologies. he authored over 60 books and received numerous awards including the prestigious dale richmond award in child development awarded by the american academy of pediatrics in 1998. i was honoured to be in the room when the academy presented the award to dr. coles and i remember his amazing intellect but most of all his humility and kindness. when we hear the word moral most will confuse it with religion. morals go beyond religion or dogma. in the academic world the study of morals consists of four competencies integrity responsibility forgiveness and compassion. when we hear the word intelligence most think of iq tests verbal and mathematical skills. but intelligence is much bigger than that. gardner s theory of multiple intelligences first described in 1983 identified seven distinct intelligences. gardner focused on verbal visual mathematical musical bodily interpersonal and intrapersonal bits of intelligence. gardner since then added an eighth nature. the list of intelligences seems to be never ending. daniel goleman s concept of emotional intelligence eq remains popular even 25 years after he wrote his bestselling book emotional intelligence. eq refers to five domains self awareness managing emotions motivating oneself empathy and handling relationships. based on my experiences over the years in my clinic and also as a father i am more and more inclined to care less about the views of experts and administrators and more about the actual needs of children. we are living in an unusual era. an era that is dramatically captured by a recent summit held by the aap on suicide prevention. many children are overwhelmed by things now that were not at play a few decades ago and many sadly end their lives. at the summit presenters shared a survey of aap members which revealed that before the pandemic 44 per cent of pediatricians had a patient attempt to die by suicide in the previous year. in 2019 in the per cent of high school students reported a suicide attempt. suicide has become the second leading cause of death for individuals ages 10 24. dr. lee beers the current president of the aap states the increasing rate of suicide among children and adolescents is an incredibly serious and growing health concern. the need for pediatricians and family physicians to become skilled at screening for suicidal ideation has never been more acute. when i reflect on moral intelligence elegantly written about in cole s book and how children develop such a skill it reminds me of tanning or fitness. one can return in the dead of winter from a sunny vacation in mexico but under cloudy chilly canadian skies the tan will fade rapidly. one can run many marathons but when dialling back on weekly mileage fitness levels deteriorate rapidly. in other words moral intelligence is an issue of cultivation from an early age and it has to be ongoing. when children are in the preschool phase of their lives they are relatively protected and parental role modelling plays a huge role. once they get immersed into school exposed to peers and social media and a materialistic world the task becomes that much harder. research has shown that instruction alone is ineffective. almost 100 years ago researchers found that children who knew the right kinds of behaviour in hypothetical situations failed to practise this behaviour in real life and that children who went to sunday school or belonged to the boys and girls scouts were just as dishonest as children who were not exposed to similar ethical instruction. clearly if our education system continues to focus only on academics and specifically a stem curriculum we may be heading in a worse direction. it is time to depoliticize curriculums and focus on the actual needs of children and enable them to survive and thrive for a lifetime.

religion,"when former us president barack obama used an old clich to denigrate his political opponent the late us senator john mccain he triggered a political controversy lasting several days. you can put lipstick on a pig but it s still a pig obama said at a campaign event in 2008. the maxim indicates that superficial changes have no bearings on outcomes and that modifying our facade does not alter who we really are. american politicians are an authority on the subject. they are experts on artificial rhetorical and ultimately shallow change. once again washington s political make up artists are busy at work. since the dramatic ousting of his former mentor israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu israel s new prime minister naftali bennett is now being presented as the alternative to netanyahu s right wing chauvinistic and rowdy political style. however for this to happen more makeup is required. much can be said about bennett and his party of ultra nationalists and right wing extremists yamina. yamina is a decidedly racist political party. their meager seven seats at the israeli knesset parliament were garnered through their constant appeal to the most violent and racist constituencies in israel whose oft repeated chant death to the arabs is a daily reminder of their sinister political discourse. bennett is often cited for this famous statement from 2013 i ve killed lots of arabs in my life and there s no problem with that. yet there is more to the man s politics than such an abhorrent declaration. since israeli leaders do not perceive any form of palestinian resistance to be legitimate and in their eyes palestinians are either terrorists or potential terrorists consider the following solution offered by bennett to deal with the problem of palestinian terrorism . as israel s minister of education in 2015 bennett proposed the building of a deterrence wall one which demands that incitement be ended and that terrorists are shot dead before they have a chance to hurt innocent people. it means that a terrorist who is shot will be dead and never walk again. it means that israel remains in control of its homeland forever unmoved by terrorism . so why does the biden administration want us to believe that bennett is different . immediately following his inauguration president joe biden was the first world leader to call and congratulate bennett on the new post. this act carries a deeper symbolic meaning when compared to the fact that it took biden a whole three long weeks to phone netanyahu following the former s own inauguration to the white house in january. a close aide to israel s new prime minister explained the nature of the amiable phone conversation between biden and bennett in an interview with the axios website. the white house wants to have close and regular consultation and engagement with bennett and his team based on candid exchange of views respect for differences a desire to work toward stability and security the israeli source was quoted as saying. aside from the emphasis on candor and respect with reference to the us israel future relationship there has also been an equal and constant emphasis on the need for privacy in dealing with differences between the two countries. unlike its predecessor the times of israel reported with reference to netanyahu the bennet government would voice its criticism of washington in private . for months the us had pleaded with netanyahu to tone down his attacks on washington to no avail. now that bennett is in charge he is clearly ready to play along. he is eager to present himself as the antithesis of netanyahu. by making such a concession he would surely be expecting washington to reciprocate. bennett understands that us politics towards israel is not determined by the attitude of israeli leaders. for example in comments made last may biden laid to rest any suggestion that the us will hold israel accountable during his term in power. there is no shift in my commitment commitment to the security of israel. if this solid pledge was made when boisterous netanyahu was still in power no change whatsoever should be expected now that the supposedly agreeable bennett is israel s new prime minister. american politicians are fawning over bennett and his main coalition partner and future prime minister yair lapid. they are eager to turn a new page and move forward past netanyahu s tumultuous years. bennett is expected to visit the us in july while lapid has already been invited to visit washington by us secretary of state antony blinken. meanwhile a large israeli military delegation headed by israeli army chief of staff aviv kohavi should already be in the us to discuss various subjects including iran hizbollah and to negotiate yet more us gifts to israel in the form of military hardware. the us is keen on rebranding its relationship with israel not because israel has changed but because washington has suffered repeated humiliation at the hands of ousted netanyahu. under netanyahu the us found itself often accused of not doing enough for israel. even obama s billion annual military aid package did not spare him the repeated israeli verbal assaults. biden is willing to do whatever it takes to avoid that sordid scenario. biden s doctrine on israel and palestine is simple. he does not want to make an actual commitment to relaunching the peace process for example nor does he want to be placed in a position where he is forced to make demands from let alone put pressure on israel. since biden has little or no expectations from israel bennett seems willing to play the role of the accommodating and sensible politician. he would be foolish not to do so for per his own political vision he merely wants to manage the conflict and prolong the occupation while like his predecessor continue to promote his own version of the deceptive notion of economic peace . while the americans and the israelis are busy engaging in the ever familiar ritual of putting lipstick on a pig the palestinians remain irrelevant in all of this as their political aspirations continue to be discounted and their freedom delayed.

science,"carl taber knelt down at the edge of a field on his 500 acre farm took a wrench to his planting machine and did something he had done only a few times before. he calibrated the equipment to plant chickpeas a crop rarely grown in upstate new york. i m pretty excited about the potential for a new crop says taber who planted 1000 pounds of chickpeas in may on a 5 acre test plot on his farm in mecklenburg in schuyler county new york about 30 minutes west of ithaca. just because it hasn t been tried here doesn t mean it won t work here. antithesis founders left to right julie flinois 19 philip kim 18 ashton yoon 19 and jason goodman 20 photographed in 2018. they are helping to develop a locally grown source of chickpeas. taber is part of a schuyler county cornell partnership to learn if chickpeas can be grown in new york state. if it works the pilot project could offer new york farmers a way to diversify their crops and rev the region s economic engine giving finger lakes food manufacturers a more cost effective sustainable source for chickpeas. the market is there taber says. we have local companies looking for product and they really would like to have something that they could put a locally grown label on. the pilot project was inspired by antithesis foods a cornell student startup that makes grabanzos a crunchy chocolate covered snack made with chickpeas. in fall 2019 antithesis co founders ceo jason goodman 20 and coo ashton yoon 19 met with judy mckinney cherry executive director of the schuyler county partnership for economic development scoped . we were giving judy a presentation on the company says yoon and when we showed her a map of our supply chain where we source and process our ingredients she was surprised and said you get your chickpeas from arizona why aren t they being grown here . susceptible to blight chickpeas have long been associated with the drier climates of africa india and the middle east where they have been grown successfully for centuries. in the most chickpeas are grown in california and the pacific northwest then dehydrated and shipped east where they are rehydrated by manufacturers. but there is evidence that certain varietals could flourish on the east coast. according to department of agriculture retail sales of foods based on legumes like chickpeas lentils and beans increased from less than 10 million in the 1990s to 700 to 800 million in recent years. according to entrepreneur magazine the hummus market is expected to top 1 billion in the next five years. asking her connections in the region s agricultural community mckinney cherry could not find anyone growing chickpeas in new york state. the team of schuyler county stakeholders help carl taber plant chickpeas in may on test plot at taber s 500 acre farm in mecklenburg new york. new york state was founded on innovation that s what put us on the map so what better way to go back to our roots than attempting to diversify our state s agriculture says mckinney cherry who quickly assembled a team of regional investors businesses researchers and farmers to explore the possibility of locally grown garbanzos. scoped is now leading the schuyler county agriculture diversification initiative with the assistance of antithesis an elab alum and rev ithaca startup works member along with cornell cooperative extension schuyler county cce the college of agriculture and life sciences cals taber hill farms kreher farms and ithaca hummus. in 2020 the initiative enlisted taber chair of the schuyler county industrial development agency to establish a 3 acre test plot of three varieties of kabuli chickpeas. looking for assistance from horticulture experts mckinney cherry reached out to laurie denardo associate director of cals office of human resources. denardo referred mckinney cherry to alan taylor professor of seed science and technology in the school of integrative plant science horticulture section at cornell agritech. taylor s lab has led extensive research on seed treatments over the past three decades with chemical and biological methods to protect seeds and seedlings from insects and diseases. i was more than glad to help with seed treatments to get this new crop off to a good start taylor says. with taylor s assistance the group acquired a fungicide seed treatment from a commercial supplier and had it applied to the seeds on campus with the help of phil atkins director of the new york seed improvement project in the school of integrative plant science. the initiative also sought guidance from cce schuyler county. despite a late planting the 2020 test plot yielded encouraging results one varietal was still growing robustly into late fall despite snowfall and offered important lessons. we learned the crop can be grown in our climate taber says. we learned that there is demand and a potential market in our region. we identified a source for seed an accomplishment in itself. to demonstrate commercial viability of the crop there will need to be an investment in processing in this region. however he says it could result in economic opportunity beyond the benefit to the farmer. i also think there is potential for this to be another crop to diversify rotations that might currently rely on spring cereals and with the soil health and fertility benefit of a legume. grabanzos are a chickpea based chocolate covered snack food developed by the cornell student startup antithesis. then goodman and yoon tested a batch of the strongest varietals to see if they measured up to chickpeas trucked into the state and successfully recreated the texture of their product. there are a lot of great reasons to grow chickpeas in new york state. we have a national brand here ithaca hummus that could potentially source chickpeas locally instead of having them trucked across the country says goodman. we have farmers in the region who are looking to diversify their crops. more people are eating chickpeas in the united states and many of those people live here on the east coast. growing chickpeas here would be a competitive advantage. now the initiative is continuing the experiment with taber s 5 acre test plot where taber planted frontier orion and chana varieties. it has been rewarding to work with innovative and entrepreneurial minded partners across the region on this effort mckinney cherry says. having the support of the private sector local citizens cornell cooperative extension cornell and elected officials all pulling in the same direction to make this happen is truly exceptional. sara baier is a marketing and communications specialist for the center for regional economic advancement.

social,ollie robinson back in action and among the wickets is congratulated by will beer picture pw sporting photography . the 24 year old new zealander led a superb recovery from 35 for four at the end of the powerplay to 162 for five against the previously unbeaten sharks. gloucestershire s seamers led by benny howell who took four wickets then did their bit to ensure phillips efforts did not go to waste. only luke wright 33 got the measure of conditions as sussex were dismissed for 135. such a scenario looked unlikely when gloucestershire made a poor start having been put in. robinson had miles hammond 3 caught at long on off his third ball before howell 4 was run out by ravi bopara s direct hit from extra cover. tymal mills had chris dent 16 caught behind and james bracey 1 taken at mid wicket in his first over but that was the last success sussex enjoyed until mills who finished with three for 20 removed skipper jack taylor in the final over. taylor helped phillips add 124 a new gloucestershire t20 record for any wicket against sussex although it wasn t until deep in the innings before they really cut loose when 82 runs were plundered in the final seven overs including 25 off left armer george garton in his last appearance before he joins up with england s one day squad. phillips who made an unbeaten 94 against glamorgan on thursday didn t hit his first six until the 12th over but added four more and seven boundaries to take his competition aggregate to 266 runs while taylor gave him excellent support with 38. sussex would still have fancied their chances of chasing at eight an over but they never recovered from losing phil salt 11 and travis head 1 in david payne s opening burst. bopara 4 and david wiese 6 also went cheaply and after skipper luke wright sliced a drive off benny howell to backward point for 33 in the ninth over sussex s race was effectively run.

social,washington gray dc a controversial mississippi law regarding abortion rights is making its way to the supreme court. after years of legal challenges the nine justices will have to make a decision with monumental ramifications. 50 years of abortion rights are at stake. you re moving in the direction of saying we don t care. we don t think you should be having abortions said paul smith from the georgetown university law center. a newly conservative supreme court is set to revisit abortion rights in the lower courts threw out the mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy but the high court has agreed to hear the case. according to smith that could give states more power and lead to further restrictions on the landmark roe v. wade decision in 1973 that legalized abortion nationwide. we re headed toward a situation i think unless the court changes very dramatically very quickly a situation where states are free to do what they want to do on abortion said smith. smith believes the supreme court would not hear the case if they were planning on ruling against the mississippi law. he says the lower courts threw out the law based on past abortion cases having to do with when a fetus is viable well after 15 weeks. hillary schneller a senior staff attorney with the center for reproductive rights is on the legal team challenging the mississippi law. she says there are enormous constitutional consequences ahead. the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy has to remain with an individual. the alternative is it s the government making this decision for people said schneller. mississippi s republican federal lawmakers are in support of their state s 15 weeks law. michael guest r ms and sen. cindy hyde smith r ms plan on officially backing the law when the case reaches the court by signing an amicus brief. i m really glad we re having the discussion because i think roe v. wade needs to be looked at said hyde smith. hyde smith hopes this is the beginning of the end for roe v. she argues scientific progress in the past 50 years reveals more about the development of fetuses after 15 weeks. guest is also pro life. he says states should be able to impose reasonable limits on when abortions can be performed. this does not prevent abortions in mississippi this just allows states to set reasonable limitations. and i do believe three and a half months into pregnancy is reasonable said guest. the mississippi case is the first major abortion dispute to test all three of former president trump s appointees to the high court. oral arguments are expected to take place in the fall.

sport,"open. the spaniard birdied the final two holes at torrey pines to complete a closing 67 and finish six under par a shot ahead of south africa s louis oosthuizen. oosthuizen who also finished runner up in last month s us pga bogeyed the 17th and needed to eagle the last for the second day running to force a play off but was unable to hole out from 69 yards having missed the fairway with his drive. rahm had just completed a sensational third round of 64 in the memorial tournament to establish a six shot lead when he was told beside the 18th green that he had tested positive for covid 19. that necessitated a period of self isolation until two days before play began at torrey pines where he won his first pga tour title in 2017 and also proposed to his wife. getty images rahm has had a whirlwind couple of weeks . and although rahm received results of two negative tests on friday and saturday to allow him to leave isolation early it was hardly the ideal way to get ready for golf s toughest major. crucially the 26 year old handled the situation with an admirable sense of perspective defending the pga tour s decision to strictly enforce their rules and noting that he still had the positive memories of his form at muirfield village to draw upon. i m a big believer in karma and after what happened a couple of weeks ago i stayed really positive knowing big things were coming rahm said. i didn t know what it was going to be but i knew we were coming to a special place i knew i got my breakthrough win here and it s a very special place for my family. getty images rahm was in remarkable form and finished with two birdies . rounds of 69 70 and 72 meant he started the final round three shots off the lead but he made the ideal start with birdies on the first and second before making what would prove his only bogey of the day on the fourth. a wild drive on the ninth looked in danger of being out of bounds but rahm was entitled to a free drop away from a fence and after hitting his second shot down the fairway spun his approach to within a few feet of the hole to set up an unlikely birdie. a run of seven straight pars on the back nine meant rahm still trailed oosthuizen by a shot as he reached the last two holes but he holed a curling birdie putt from 25 feet on the 17th and a similar putt on the par five 18th after finding a bunker with his approach. defending champion bryson dechambeau had taken the lead with his second birdie of the day on the eighth the american coming agonisingly close to making a hole in one. however dechambeau imploded on the back nine with two bogeys a double bogey on the 13th and a quadruple bogey eight on the 17th eventually signing for a closing 77. rory mcilroy s bid for a first major title since 2014 also unravelled in the closing stages the northern irishman having been part of a four way tie for the lead following a birdie on the fourth. getty images rory mcilroy saw his best efforts unravel . mcilroy three putted the 11th and ran up a double bogey on the 12th to effectively end his chances a closing 73 leaving him in a tie for seventh. earlier in the day phil mickelson s unique opportunity to complete the career grand slam in his home city of san diego came to an unusual end almost two hours before the final group was due to tee off. mickelson began the week with renewed hope of winning his national open for the first time but ended it by hitting his approach to the 18th around 70 yards beyond the hole and completing a 75 to finish 11 over par. the 51 year old was disappointed not to have played better but remains confident he can replicate the form which made him the oldest ever major winner in last month s us pga championship. there s some opportunities coming up with the way i ve been playing that i m optimistic that i can compete and contend the six time major winner said. erik s lesser epa efe rex shutterstock phil mickelson could n t follow up his us pga win . there s nothing more fun for me than to be in it on the weekend. i ve actually been playing well enough to have chances and we have some good tournaments coming up the next couple of months. afterwards i ll look back and reminisce when the season s over and i ll still have that wanamaker trophy i ll be looking at and i m still looking to add a friend to it along the line. that win was very meaningful to me because i ve been putting in a lot of work the last couple of years and getting nothing out of it and so to have a moment like that is something that makes it worthwhile.

unrest,"ap knoxville police chief eve thomas gets a phone call every time someone is shot to death in the city. she s received 22 of those calls this year. four came the week of may 17. you ve got family she told knox news adding that she s the mother of a 22 year old and a 19 year old. that s really the first thing that goes through my mind is those officers are having to make notification to that family that they ve lost a loved one and that is hard. i ve done it more times than i care to do. but that family s life is changed forever. knoxville is in the midst of one of its most violent periods in modern history. last year the city saw 37 homicides its highest annual figure on record according to fbi statistics that date back to 1985. this year is on pace to be even worse the city has already recorded 22 killings a number that includes the fatal shooting by a knoxville police department officer of 17 year old anthony thompson jr. in a bathroom at austin east magnet high school in april. all of this year s homicides are shootings and an alarming number have involved teenagers on both sides of the gun. five teens including thompson have been killed and three including one as young as 14 face serious charges in those cases. prosecutors found the police shooting of thompson to be legally justifiable. as summer approaches city officials are trying different things in a bid to curb the violence. new efforts include the creation of a knoxville police department unit dedicated to what thomas described as proactive community policing as well as a city program to fund job opportunities for at risk youth from june through september. in february two austin east students were shot to death four days apart. authorities say two boys ages 14 and 16 opened fire on stanley freeman jr. 16 as he left the high school on feb. 12 and both are in custody. four days later 16 year old janaria muhammad was shot outside her family s home on selma avenue in a case that remains unsolved. the knoxville police department responded by requiring all patrol officers to work overtime thomas said in a recent interview. they worked 12 hour shifts for five weeks. while the officers on day and night shifts continued to respond to 911 calls the officers on the evening shift focused on deterrence she said. the efforts largely focused on the city s east side where much of this year s violence has occurred. thomas said officers conducted traffic stops and walked the neighborhood to foster conversations with community members. when officers don t have to respond to calls she said they have more time to investigate a tip that a shooting might occur for example or knock on doors to assist with an investigation. the chief felt those five weeks were successful but not sustainable. it s hard to work overtime all the time she said. you start having crashes you start having bad decisions. so we just can t do that all the time. the police department ended 12 hour shifts but created a new patrol unit called the community engagement response team. officers interviewed in late march for positions in the unit which is meant to continue that kind of proactive work. it s composed of 10 officers and two sergeants and is overseen by lt. they re not on the street answering calls for service thomas said. they re actually just chasing leads hotspots things where we may get a tip in that there s going to be a shooting and this guy has a gun. he may be a known felon that has a gun that we may be able to do something with. they can do that immediately without saying uh i got a 911 call that deals with a they re not tied to the radio in that way. knoxville s charlene roberts knows the pain of getting a call about the death of a loved one. in january she lost her son kevin and in 2019 she lost her daughter jessie who was killed by a stray bullet while waiting in a krystal s drive thru line. she s glad to see police take a proactive approach after two years with no answers in her daughter s death. we need more officers who can follow up on leads and do searches. they need to be able to focus on the violence going on alone. crimestoppers isn t enough she said. this sounds like a great thing. i hope the route they are going is going to lead to justice for more people. imani shula a criminal justice reform activist said the department needs to focus on two things building trust and protecting the vulnerable. you have one side of the community that doesn t trust them because they are police. and then you have another side of the community that doesn t trust them to do their job and follow up she said. i hope attention will also be given to families who need protection that face retaliation that s my concern with this. new job program begins in june . thomas said she believes there are too many guns on the streets and that too many are falling into the hands of young people who really don t understand them and don t understand the finality of death. kathy mack community engagement manager at the city of knoxville s office of community empowerment hopes a new city program will help with that. the summer youth violence prevention pilot will kick off in june and pays for jobs for at risk youth ages 12 to 21 through september mack said. mack former director of the ywca phyllis wheatley center in east knoxville said the program was created after city officials met with community members to discuss the roots of youth involvement in crime. one of the things we heard loud and clear and some of this ties to the pandemic young people need things to do. they need opportunities to earn money she said. we wanted to be able to provide this opportunity in the summer. school is out and students won t be in those structured settings so we re trying to segue that structure into the summer and support the work community organizations and groups are doing. organizations can apply to participate in the program. mack s office is using a one page application in an attempt to streamline the process. a community review committee will meet june 8 to review the applications and decide which organizations will be approved. organizations will then receive money from the city to pay teens beginning in mid june. eighty percent of that money will go to the youth as a stipend while the remainder will go to the organization mack said. the program is funded by 200000 of the 1 million approved for violence prevention efforts by the city council in february. summer youth job programs have grown increasingly popular in cities in recent years. some studies including ones conducted in boston and chicago have found they can be effective to reduce crime and incarceration. mack highlighted other city programs such as summer in the city an initiative that gives teens and young adults paid internship opportunities in city departments. although that program s not new she said the emphasis has changed given the recent violence. i always say our heartbeat is our young people she said. pamela campbell bost a grandmother and resident of east knoxville said she wishes she had the chance for a summer job like this back when she was a ""

unrest,"president joe biden speaks during an event in the state dining room of the white house in washington wednesday june 23 2021 to discuss his gun crime prevention strategy. president joe biden s plan to curb rising violence relies on several steps more aid to local police departments expanding job programs for young adults more violence intervention programs and tougher measures to shut down gun sellers who break federal laws. rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren t legally allowed to own them biden said june 23. there has always been the ability to limit rationally limit the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it. and biden said that power was rooted in history. the second amendment from the day it was passed limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own biden said. you couldn t buy a cannon. we reached out to the white house and received no comment but biden s statement is not accurate history. during the campaign biden made a similar claim about cannons in the revolutionary war and who could own them. this time on top of that biden misrepresents what the second amendment says. the text of the second amendment is short a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. university of tennessee law professor glenn harlan reynolds said the amendment s few words speak for themselves. the second amendment places no limits on individual ownership of cannon or any other arms reynolds said. there have been many court cases to resolve whether the amendment confers an individual right to bear arms. in 2008 the supreme court ruled that it does. setting aside ongoing disagreements over that ruling fordham university law professor nicholas johnson said the amendment limited government action not people. the first federal gun control law does not appear until the 20th century johnson said. that law the national firearms act came in 1934 when machine guns were the weapon of choice of prohibition era gangsters. the law was drafted before prohibition ended in 1933. when attorney general homer cummings made the case for the law before the house ways and means committee he based it on the government s power to tax and regulate interstate commerce not the second amendment. if we made a statute absolutely forbidding any human being to have a machine gun you might say there is some constitutional question involved cummings said april 16 1934. but when you say we will tax the machine gun and when you say that the absence of a license showing payment of the tax has been made indicates that a crime has been perpetrated you are easily within the law. from the way biden put it the second amendment regulated weapons. the more immediate driver in 1787 was the desire to keep the federal government in check. the framers of the constitution agreed that a federal government might need a standing army. but coming out from under one despot they wanted to avoid creating another. this was something that federalists and anti federalists could agree on wrote valparaiso law professor david vandercoy. both believed the greatest danger to the new republic was tyrannical government and that the ultimate check on tyranny was an armed population vandercoy wrote in 1994. there were some state and local laws after the second amendment was adopted in 1792 that limited firearms. the most sweeping ones barred black people free or enslaved from owning them. a 1792 virginia law for example said no negro or mulatto whatsoever shall keep or carry any gun powder shot club or other weapon whatsoever. historian saul cornell at fordham found other laws aimed at controlling certain groups. some banned gun ownership by people who backed the british. others targeted native americans. cornell also pointed to a 1795 massachusetts law that mainly targeted rioters but gave local authorities broad latitude to arrest people who carried firearms. the national rifle association will call out biden correctly that there were no modern style gun control laws in the founding era because there was little interpersonal gun violence among persons of european origin cornell said. gun control groups will correctly say that a variety of robust regulations existed at the time of the second amendment and that the founders feared anarchy as much as tyranny. cornell argues that for about the first 50 years after passage of the second amendment gun technology was limited. the issues of crime and safety that drive the modern debate he said didn t begin to emerge until manufacturers began producing reliable affordable guns in greater volume. biden said that from the start the second amendment limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own. the second amendment limited government power not the rights of individuals. laws at the time that limited firearm ownership were primarily racist aimed at controlling black people and native americans. broadly gun regulation came decades after passage of the second amendment when gun technology changed. the first national gun regulation law did not rely on the second amendment.

unrest,"orange county considers restrictions on pet stores . orange county commissioners are considering an ordinance that would ban pet stores here from selling puppies kittens and bunnies. orlando fla. by a vote of 4 3 orange county commissioners have approved an ordinance that would ban pet stores from selling cats dogs and rabbits. over 50 people spoke during the public comment portion at an orange county commission meeting on tuesday. proponents of the pet store restrictions and groups such as the humane society argue that some animals sold at pet stores are the product of for profit breeding. they encourage adopting animals from pet shelters instead. pet store revenue is greatly driven by sales of puppies kittens and bunnies so an ordinance banning the sale of those animals could put a number of places out of business. related orange county proposal would limit protests in neighborhoods . commissioners were also expected to take up an ordinance to greatly restrict targeted picketing in residential areas. the proposed ordinance would keep people from picketing on public property within 150 feet of a person s home. it was proposed by orange county sheriff john mina earlier this month. it comes after protests last year outside the windermere home of former minneapolis police officer derek chauvin who was found guilty in the death of george floyd.

protests including section 505 a of myanmar s penal code which makes it a crime to spread comments that create public unrest or fear or spread false news and carries a penalty of up to three years in

part in the protests but did not take part in the violence who did not commit crimes and did not lead the riots. the assistance association for political prisoner said tuesday that 5224 people were in

the public a large part of which is hostile to it. on tuesday it announced that it was dropping charges against about two dozen celebrities who had taken a role in the protests. it would also like to soften its international image. the general assembly on june 18 passed a resolution calling for an arms embargo against the southeast asian nation and condemning the military s seizure of power.

russian girlfriend. ufeff ufeff . kyiv  ukraine ap a dissident journalist arrested when belarus diverted his flight said in a video from prison that he has been set up by an unidentified associate. the footage of raman pratasevich was part of an hour long tv program aired late wednesday by the state controlled ont channel. in the film  the 26 year old pratasevich is also shown saying that protests against belarus authoritarian president alexander lukashenko are now pointless amid a tough crackdown and suggesting that the opposition wait for a more opportune moment. a top associate of pratasevich said the journalist was clearly speaking under duress. the tv program claimed that the belarusian authorities were unaware that pratasevich was on board the ryanair jet en route from athens to vilnius when flight controllers diverted it to minsk on may 23 citing a bomb threat. no bomb was found after the landing  but pratasevich was arrested along with his russian girlfriend. the flight s diversion outraged the european union  which responded by barring the belarusian flag carrier from its skies  telling european carriers to skirt belarus and drafting new bruising sanctions against key sectors of the belarusian economy. lukashenko  who has ruled the ex soviet nation of million with an iron fist for more than a quarter century  has accused the west of trying to strangle his country with sanctions. belarus has been rocked by months of protests fueled by his reelection to a sixth term in an august 2020 vote that was widely seen as rigged. lukashenko responded with an increasingly harsh crackdown. more than 35 000 people have been arrested since the protests began  with thousands beaten. pratasevich  who left belarus in 2019  has become a top foe of lukashenko. he ran a widely popular channel on the telegram messaging app that played a key role in helping organize the huge anti government protests and was charged with inciting mass disturbances accusations that carry a 15 year prison sentence. lukashenko last week accused pratasevich of fomenting a bloody rebellion. speaking in the ont film  pratasevich acknowledged that the protests have fizzled and argued that the opposition should wait until economic problems foment broad public discontent. we need to wait until the economic situation worsens . and people take to the street for a mug of soup  to put it bluntly  he said. lukashenko has defended the ryanair flight diversion as a legitimate response to the bomb threat. the ont program appeared designed to back that contention by claiming that the belarusian authorities were unaware that pratasevich was on the plane when they diverted it. in the video  the journalist said he put a notice about his travel plans on a chat with associates 40 minutes before his departure. he alleged that the bomb threat could have been issued by someone with whom he had a personal conflict. his remarks didn t elaborate on the conflict. pratasevich charged that the perceived ill wisher whom he did n t name had links with opposition minded hackers who have attacked belarusian official websites and issued bomb threats in the past. when the plane was on a landing path  i realized that it s useless to panic  pratasevich said. once the plane taxied to a parking spot  he described seeing heavily armed special forces waiting. last month  pratasevich noted he had a rift with franak viachorka  an adviser to sviatlana tsikhanouskaya  the main opposition candidate in the august presidential election who left after the vote for lithuania under official pressure. viachorka and pratasevich both accompanied tsikhanouskaya on a visit to greece in may. asked about the video  viachorka told the associated press that pratasevich now is a hostage under pressure and insisted they have maintained friendly ties. a day after his arrest  pratasevich appeared in a video from detention that was broadcast on belarusian state tv. speaking rapidly and in a monotone  he said he was confessing to staging mass disturbances. his parents  who now live in poland  said the confession seemed to be coerced. in the ont film  pratasevich said he tried to stay away from his girlfriend after the landing  hoping that the authorities wouldn t arrest her. sofia sapega didn t feature in the new tv program but she was shown in a video from prison last week  confessing to running a channel that revealed personal data about belarusian security officers. this terrifying footage shows the moment a group of sightseers took a boat out to look for hippos  only to end up

weather,"file in this april 9 2021 file photo sprinklers water grass near a street corner in the summerlin neighborhood of northwest las vegas. steve sisolak signed legislation on friday june 4 to make the state the first in the nation to ban certain kinds of grass. the measure will ban water users in southern nevada from planting decorative grass in an effort to conserve water. ken ritter ap 2 3 file in this april 9 2021 file photo traffic passes a grassy landscape on green valley parkway in suburban henderson nev. nevada governor steve sisolak signed legislation on friday june 4 to make the state the first in the nation to ban certain kinds of grass. the measure will ban water users in southern nevada from planting decorative grass in an effort to conserve water. ap in sin city one thing that will soon become unforgivable is useless grass. a new nevada law will outlaw about 31 of the grass in the las vegas area in an effort to conserve water amid a drought that s drying up the region s primary water source the colorado river. other cities and states around the have enacted temporary bans on lawns that must be watered but legislation signed friday by gov. steve sisolak makes nevada the first in the nation to enact a permanent ban on certain categories of grass. sisolak said last week that anyone flying into las vegas viewing the bathtub rings that delineate how high lake mead s water levels used to be can see that conservation is needed. it s incumbent upon us for the next generation to be more conscious of conservation and our natural resources water being particularly important he said. the ban targets what the southern nevada water authority calls non functional turf. it applies to grass that virtually no one uses at office parks in street medians and at entrances to housing developments. it excludes single family homes parks and golf courses. nevada assemblyman howard watts iii the bill s sponsor said he hopes other western states consider similar action leading up to 2026 when they renegotiate the colorado river s drought contingency plan. he applauded sisolak for taking concrete action on conservation after utah gov. spencer cox asked people to pray for rain last week. there s broad acceptance in southern nevada that if we can take some grass out to preserve the water supply for our communities then that s something that we need to do he said. this sends a clear message about what other states need to be looking at in order to preserve water. the measure will require the replacement of about 6 square miles 16 square kilometers of grass in the metro las vegas area. by ripping it out water officials estimate the region can conserve 10 of its total available colorado river water supply and save about 11 gallons 41 liters per person per day in a region with a population of about million. replacing non functional turf from southern nevada will allow for more sustainable and efficient use of resources build resiliency to climate change and help ensure the community s current and future water needs continue to be met said southern nevada water authority general manager john entsminger. the ban was passed by state lawmakers with bipartisan support and backing from groups like great basin water network conservation group and the southern nevada homebuilders association which wants to free up water to allow for projected growth and future construction. when the ban takes effect in 2027 it will apply only to southern nevada water authority jurisdiction which encompasses las vegas and its surrounding areas and relies on the colorado river for 90 of its water supply. as the region has grown the agency has prohibited developers from planting grass front lawns in new subdivisions and has spent years offering some of the region s most generous rebates to owners of older properties up to 3 per square foot square meters to tear out grass and replace it with drought tolerant landscaping. water officials have said waning demand for those rebates has made bolder measures necessary. the legislation also mandates the formation of an advisory committee to carve out exceptions to the ban. other cities and states have enacted temporary grass bans during short term droughts but nevada is the first place in the country to put in place a regional ban on certain uses of grass. the ban came as the seven states that rely on the over tapped colorado river for water arizona california colorado nevada new mexico utah and wyoming reckon with the prospect of a drier future. lake mead and lake powell the two reservoirs where colorado river water is stored are projected to shrink this year to levels that would trigger the region s first ever official shortage declaration and cut the amount allocated to nevada and arizona. water officials in both states have said that even with the cuts they ll still have enough water to accommodate projected population growth but are working to limit certain kinds of consumption. in arizona farmers in pinal county south of phoenix have had to stop irrigating their fields because of the cuts. nevada stands to lose about 4 of its allocation although the state has historically not used its entire share. this version corrects that the ban on non functional turf will require the replacement of 6 square miles 16 square kilometers of grass or about 31 of turf in the las vegas metro not 8 square miles 21 square kilometers and 40 .

weather,"covering up with a hat to ward off heat exhaustion is a must says environment canada. a heat wave consuming huge swaths of north america is set to hit british columbia bringing unprecedented temperatures and triggering extreme weather warnings across western canada. on wednesday the meteorological service of canada forecasted unprecedented temperatures over the next several days warning of daytime highs above 40 c across some areas of by late afternoon environment canada had issued 31 public weather alerts due to a dangerous long duration heat wave set to hit the region friday and stay until tuesday. the warnings cover an area stretching from the northeast corner of to the east coast of vancouver island and encompass metro vancouver and much of the province s interior. humidity will make temperatures in metro vancouver feel as high as 43 c sunday and monday according to the weather network. in kamloops temperatures are expected to feel like 44 c sunday and in abbotsford highs could feel like 48 c monday. the extreme weather warnings come amid growing drought like conditions across much of southern british columbia. armel castellan a warning preparedness meteorologist with environment canada describes the incoming weather as the main event after a dry may. we ve had record breaking dryness for the interior and south coast says castellan. now we re talking about dangerous conditions. if records were to fall in june it would buck annual trends where the hottest days come in july and august castellan explains. the weather is expected to be so hot it is being treated as a public health threat with infants and young children older adults and people with chronic conditions facing the greatest risks. those working outside in such conditions also need to protect themselves as best they can. environment canada recommends drinking plenty of water checking in on older family friends and neighbours and to check for signs of heat illness such as . nausea vomiting . extreme thirst . decreased urination with unusually dark urine. more information can be found on the healthlink bc website or by calling 811. in kamloops where environment canada forecasts temperatures to hit 40 c saturday through monday a local homelessness outreach group warned the rising heat would lead to fatal consequences. urgent writes the mustard seed in a call for donations from its supporters wednesday after going through a few hundred cases of water within the last week. with temperatures reaching close to 40 degrees over the next week those individuals out all day on the street are about to face another heat wave. we have run out of water bottles to support those living on the street. castellan echoes the call to protect most vulnerable from heatstroke and death. yes we might see wildfires start yes we might see drought get worse and worse but in the immediate term there s lots we can do to prepare for this heat says castellan. the coming heat is expected to be made worse by extreme uv indexes. so soon after the solstice uv levels have reached peak levels in many parts of the province covering up with a hat to ward off heat exhaustion is a must he says. castellan also recommends anyone with an air conditioner check that it s in working order. those without one should check in with their local municipality to see what buildings will be offered up as cooling stations. the evening is not expected to offer much respite. we re talking about maybe 20 degrees overnight says castellan. our bodies won t have the opportunity to cool off and recharge for the next day of heat. what s driving the heat . but the latest heat wave is something else. faron anslow leads climate analysis and monitoring at the victoria based pacific climate impact consortium. he says it s normal for the heat dome usually sitting on top of the southwest to push into over the summer. a heat dome forms when the jet stream migrates north allowing an intense high pressure system to create a cap over hot ocean air. when that air descends it warms. by trapping heat at the surface the dome creates a feedback effect leading to sweltering conditions from day to night. what s different about the approaching high pressure ridge this time is its huge amplitude. this is in that more rare category says anslow. the ridge from north to south is large. it s got a lot of hot air embedded in it. that wave of high pressure is so large says anslow that it s expected to bring extreme hot weather to a region stretching from oregon to southern alaska. it s also expected to bounce back with another round of hot weather a week later. the climatologist says when he looks back at the climate record in the upcoming five day average is on the order of 8 to 10 degrees celsius above normal. climate scientists are not quite at the point where they can pin a single extreme weather event to climate change on the fly but all the telltale signs are there says anslow. what we can say
